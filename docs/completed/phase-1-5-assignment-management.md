# Phase 1.5: Assignment Management - Completed Summary

## 📋 Overview

Phase 1.5 successfully implemented comprehensive assignment management within course sections, allowing teachers to create assignments that link clients and rubrics, with support for both practice and graded modes. This phase built upon the course section foundation from Phase 1.4.

**Duration**: ~4 hours across 8 parts  
**Total Tests Added**: 77 (62 assignment + 15 student viewing)  
**Total Project Tests**: 300 (all passing ✅)  
**Code Coverage**: Maintained 80%+

## 🎯 What Was Built

### Core Features Implemented

1. **Assignment Management**
   - Full CRUD operations for assignments
   - Practice vs Graded assignment types
   - Draft/Published states with publishing workflow
   - Date-based availability (available_from/due_date)
   - Configurable max attempts
   - Flexible settings via JSON field

2. **Assignment-Client Relationships**
   - Many-to-many relationship between assignments and clients
   - Each assignment-client pair has its own rubric
   - Soft delete for preserving history
   - Display ordering for student experience
   - Bulk operations support

3. **Student Access Control**
   - Students can only view published assignments
   - Enrollment-based filtering
   - Date range filtering (available/due dates)
   - Security through 404 responses (don't reveal existence)

## 📊 Implementation Details by Part

### Part 1: Assignment Database Models (✅ Completed)
Created `backend/models/assignment.py` with:
- **AssignmentDB**: Core assignment model with SQLAlchemy
- **Pydantic Schemas**: AssignmentCreate, AssignmentUpdate, Assignment
- **Key Fields**: section_id, title, description, type, settings, dates, is_published
- **Validation**: Title length, date ordering, max attempts

### Part 2: Assignment-Client Junction Model (✅ Completed)
Extended `assignment.py` with:
- **AssignmentClientDB**: Junction table with soft delete
- **Unique Constraint**: One client per assignment
- **Display Order**: Control client presentation order
- **Schemas**: AssignmentClientCreate, AssignmentClient

### Part 3: Assignment Service Core (✅ Completed)
Created `backend/services/assignment_service.py` with:
- **CRUD Operations**: create, get, update, delete assignments
- **Permission Checks**: Integrated with section_service
- **Teacher Isolation**: All queries filtered by teacher ownership
- **Efficient Queries**: Proper joins to avoid N+1 problems

### Part 4: Assignment Teacher Endpoints (✅ Completed)
Added to `teacher_routes.py`:
- **GET /teacher/sections/{id}/assignments**: List assignments
- **POST /teacher/sections/{id}/assignments**: Create assignment
- **GET /teacher/assignments/{id}**: Get assignment details
- **PUT /teacher/assignments/{id}**: Update assignment
- **DELETE /teacher/assignments/{id}**: Delete assignment

### Part 5: Assignment Publishing (✅ Completed)
Added publishing endpoints:
- **POST /teacher/assignments/{id}/publish**: Publish assignment
- **POST /teacher/assignments/{id}/unpublish**: Unpublish assignment
- **Business Rules**: Date validation, state transitions
- **Security**: Only drafts visible to teachers

### Part 6: Assignment-Client Management (✅ Completed)
Added client management endpoints:
- **GET /teacher/assignments/{id}/clients**: List assignment clients
- **POST /teacher/assignments/{id}/clients**: Add single client
- **POST /teacher/assignments/{id}/clients/bulk**: Add multiple clients
- **DELETE /teacher/assignments/{id}/clients/{client_id}**: Remove client
- **Features**: Soft delete, duplicate prevention, rubric validation

### Part 7: Student Assignment Viewing (✅ Completed)
Added to `student_routes.py`:
- **GET /student/sections/{id}/assignments**: List section assignments
- **GET /student/assignments/{id}**: Get assignment details
- **GET /student/assignments/{id}/clients**: List assignment clients
- **Security**: Enrollment check, published only, date filtering

### Part 8: Testing & Documentation (✅ Completed)
- **Full Test Suite**: 300 tests passing
- **API Documentation**: Auto-generated via FastAPI
- **Data Models**: Already documented in DATA_MODELS.md
- **Phase Summary**: This document

## 🏗️ Key Patterns Established

### 1. Assignment State Management
```python
# Draft assignments only visible to teachers
if not is_teacher:
    query = query.filter(AssignmentDB.is_published == True)

# Publishing requires date validation
if assignment.available_from and assignment.available_from > datetime.utcnow():
    raise ValueError("Cannot publish assignment with future available_from date")
```

### 2. Soft Delete for Assignment-Clients
```python
# Soft delete preserves history
assignment_client.is_active = False

# Reactivation on re-add
existing = db.query(AssignmentClientDB).filter_by(
    assignment_id=assignment_id,
    client_id=client_id
).first()
if existing:
    existing.is_active = True
    existing.rubric_id = rubric_id
```

### 3. Efficient Client Loading
```python
# Single query with joins
clients = db.query(AssignmentClientDB)\
    .options(
        joinedload(AssignmentClientDB.client),
        joinedload(AssignmentClientDB.rubric)
    )\
    .filter_by(assignment_id=assignment_id, is_active=True)\
    .order_by(AssignmentClientDB.display_order)\
    .all()
```

### 4. Student Security Pattern
```python
# 404 for both not found and not enrolled
if not assignment or not is_enrolled:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Assignment not found")
```

## 📈 Testing Coverage

## 🔑 Important Implementation Notes

### 1. Service Dependencies
The assignment service depends on several other services:
- **section_service**: For permission checks
- **client_service**: For client validation
- **rubric_service**: For rubric validation
- **enrollment_service**: For student access control

### 2. Date Handling
- All dates stored in UTC
- Frontend responsible for timezone conversion
- Available/due date filtering happens at service layer

### 3. Settings Field
The JSON settings field allows flexible configuration:
```python
settings = {
    "time_limit": 30,
    "allow_notes": True,
    "show_rubric": True,
    "randomize_clients": False
}
```

### 4. Future Considerations
- Assignment templates for common scenarios
- Copy/duplicate assignment functionality
- Batch operations for managing multiple assignments
- Assignment categories or tags
- Grade passthrough to external LMS

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Circular Import Prevention**: Careful service initialization order prevents circular imports
2. **Test Fixture Management**: Consistent fixture naming prevents confusion
3. **Soft Delete Benefits**: Preserves history while allowing reactivation
4. **Security Through Obscurity**: 404 responses hide existence from unauthorized users
5. **Bulk Operations**: Essential for teacher efficiency with large client pools
