# Current Sprint: Phase 1.4 Part 7 - Section Statistics

## üìç Session Handoff
**Last Updated**: 2025-05-25
**Last Completed**: Fixed test infrastructure issues ‚úÖ
**Ready to Start**: Phase 1.4 Part 7 - Section Statistics implementation
**Tests Passing**: 
- Student Section API: 11/11 ‚úÖ
- Rubric API: 21/21 ‚úÖ
- Enrollment API: 15/15 ‚úÖ
- Section API: 18/18 ‚úÖ
- Unit tests: 73/85 (12 database tests need fixture update)
- Total: 132 tests passing, 6 section stats tests failing (expected - not implemented yet)
**Notes for Next Session**: Test infrastructure is now working correctly. Ready to implement Section Statistics endpoints.

## üìç Where We Are in the Journey
- **Current Phase**: 1.4 Course Section Management (Parts 1-6 ‚úÖ, Part 7 in progress)
- **Next Part**: Part 8 - Testing & Documentation  
- **Next Phase**: 1.5 Assignment Management
- **Overall Progress**: ~56% of Phase 1 complete (12.9 of 23 hours minimum)
- **See**: [`PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`](PROJECT_ROADMAP.md) for full context

**Status**: Ready to Start | **Estimated Time**: 30-40 minutes

## üéØ Sprint Goal
Add statistics endpoints for teachers to view enrollment counts and section status.

## üìã Tasks
1. [ ] Add `get_section_stats()` method to `section_service.py`
2. [ ] Add `get_all_sections_stats()` method to `section_service.py`
3. [ ] Add GET `/api/teacher/sections/stats` endpoint
4. [ ] Add GET `/api/teacher/sections/{id}/stats` endpoint
5. [ ] Write integration tests
6. [ ] Ensure efficient SQL queries (no N+1 problems)

## üîß Implementation Details

### Service Methods to Add

#### 1. section_service.get_section_stats()
```python
def get_section_stats(self, db: Session, section_id: str) -> dict:
    """
    Get enrollment statistics for a single section.
    
    Returns:
        {
            "section_id": str,
            "active_enrollments": int,
            "inactive_enrollments": int,
            "total_enrollments": int
        }
    """
```

#### 2. section_service.get_all_sections_stats()
```python
def get_all_sections_stats(self, db: Session, teacher_id: str) -> List[dict]:
    """
    Get enrollment statistics for all teacher's sections.
    Uses efficient SQL to avoid N+1 queries.
    
    Returns:
        List of stats dictionaries with section info
    """
```

### Endpoints to Implement

#### 1. GET `/api/teacher/sections/stats`
- **Purpose**: Get statistics for all teacher's sections
- **Returns**: List of sections with enrollment counts
- **Example Response**:
```json
[
    {
        "section_id": "uuid",
        "name": "SW 101 - Fall 2025",
        "active_enrollments": 25,
        "inactive_enrollments": 3,
        "total_enrollments": 28
    }
]
```

#### 2. GET `/api/teacher/sections/{id}/stats`
- **Purpose**: Get detailed statistics for a specific section
- **Returns**: Single section statistics
- **Security**: 404 if section doesn't exist or belongs to another teacher

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Patterns to Follow

**Efficient Queries** ‚Üí Use SQL COUNT() and GROUP BY
**Security** ‚Üí Teacher can only see their own sections' stats
**Zero Handling** ‚Üí Return 0 counts for sections with no enrollments
**Response Format** ‚Üí Include section metadata with stats

## üß™ Testing Requirements

Create `tests/integration/test_section_stats_api.py`:
1. Test stats for section with enrollments
2. Test stats for section with no enrollments
3. Test bulk stats endpoint
4. Test 404 for non-existent section
5. Test 403 for other teacher's section
6. Test inactive enrollment counting

## ‚ùå What NOT to Do
- Don't load all enrollments into memory (use SQL aggregation)
- Don't expose individual student information
- Don't create N+1 query problems
- Don't include sensitive data in stats

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done
- [ ] Both stats endpoints working
- [ ] Efficient SQL queries (single query for bulk stats)
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Zero counts handled correctly

## üìö Quick Reference
- **SQL aggregation**: Use COUNT() with GROUP BY
- **Service pattern**: See section_service.py
- **Error handling**: See PATTERNS.md "Standard Error Responses"
- **Testing pattern**: See existing section API tests

## ‚úÖ Tests to Run
**After implementing Part 7**:
- `python -m pytest tests/integration/test_section_stats_api.py -v` (new)
- `python -m pytest tests/integration/test_section_api.py -v` (regression)
- `python test_quick.py` (general smoke test)

**If any failures occur**:
1. Fix the issue
2. Re-run the specific failing test
3. Document any persistent issues in Session Handoff
