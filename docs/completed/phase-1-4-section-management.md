# Phase 1.4: Course Section Management (Parts 1-5)

**Completed**: ~3.9 hours of estimated 3.5-4.5 hours | **Status**: Parts 1-5 ✅ Complete

## Overview
Implementing course sections and enrollment management. Sections form the organizational foundation for teacher-student relationships.

## Completed Parts

### Part 1: Database Models and Schema (25 min) ✅
**Created**: `backend/models/course_section.py`

**Models**:
- `CourseSectionDB` - Course section with teacher ownership
- `SectionEnrollmentDB` - Student enrollment with soft delete

**Key Features**:
- UUID primary keys
- Teacher isolation via teacher_id
- Soft delete pattern for enrollments
- Role field for future TA support

### Part 2: Basic Section Service (30 min) ✅
**Created**: `backend/services/section_service.py`

**Methods**:
- `get_teacher_sections()` - Filter by teacher
- `create_section_for_teacher()` - Create with teacher assignment
- `can_update()` / `can_delete()` - Permission checks

**Tests**: 11 unit tests all passing

### Part 3: Section CRUD Endpoints (45 min) ✅
**Added to**: `backend/api/teacher_routes.py`

**Endpoints**:
- GET `/api/teacher/sections` - List teacher's sections
- POST `/api/teacher/sections` - Create section
- GET `/api/teacher/sections/{id}` - Get section details
- PUT `/api/teacher/sections/{id}` - Update section
- DELETE `/api/teacher/sections/{id}` - Delete section

**Features**:
- Full teacher isolation
- Comprehensive error handling
- 18 integration tests passing

### Part 4: Enrollment Service Layer (45 min) ✅
**Created**: `backend/services/enrollment_service.py`

**Methods**:
- `enroll_student()` - Handles duplicates via reactivation
- `unenroll_student()` - Soft delete preserving history
- `get_section_roster()` - List students with optional inactive
- `is_student_enrolled()` - Check active enrollment
- `get_student_sections()` - Get all student's sections

**Business Rules**:
- No duplicate active enrollments
- Reactivate existing enrollments on re-enroll
- Soft delete maintains history
- Section validation before enrollment

**Tests**: 20 unit tests with SQLAlchemy session fixes

### Part 5: Enrollment Management Endpoints (45 min) ✅
**Added to**: `backend/api/teacher_routes.py`

**Endpoints**:
- GET `/api/teacher/sections/{id}/roster` - View enrolled students
- POST `/api/teacher/sections/{id}/enroll` - Enroll student
- DELETE `/api/teacher/sections/{id}/enroll/{student_id}` - Unenroll (soft)

**Features**:
- Teacher can only manage own sections
- Enrollment reactivation on re-enroll
- Proper 404/403 error handling
- 15 integration tests passing

## Key Patterns Established

### Soft Delete Pattern
```python
def unenroll_student(self, db: Session, section_id: str, student_id: str) -> bool:
    enrollment = db.query(SectionEnrollmentDB).filter(
        SectionEnrollmentDB.section_id == section_id,
        SectionEnrollmentDB.student_id == student_id,
        SectionEnrollmentDB.is_active == True
    ).first()
    
    if enrollment:
        enrollment.is_active = False
        db.commit()
        return True
    return False
```

### Reactivation Pattern
```python
def enroll_student(self, db: Session, section_id: str, student_id: str, role: str = "student"):
    # Check for existing enrollment (active or inactive)
    existing = db.query(SectionEnrollmentDB).filter(
        SectionEnrollmentDB.section_id == section_id,
        SectionEnrollmentDB.student_id == student_id
    ).first()
    
    if existing:
        if existing.is_active:
            return existing  # Already enrolled
        else:
            # Reactivate
            existing.is_active = True
            existing.enrolled_at = datetime.utcnow()
            db.commit()
            return existing
```

### Service Composition
```python
@router.get("/sections/{section_id}/roster")
def get_section_roster(
    section_id: str,
    teacher_id: str = Depends(get_current_teacher),
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
):
    # Verify ownership using section_service
    if not section_service.can_update(db, section_id, teacher_id):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="...")
    
    # Get roster using enrollment_service
    return enrollment_service.get_section_roster(db, section_id)
```

## Database Schema

### course_sections
- id (UUID, PK)
- teacher_id (String, FK)
- name (String)
- description (Text, nullable)
- course_code (String, nullable)
- term (String, nullable)
- is_active (Boolean)
- settings (JSON)
- created_at (DateTime)

### section_enrollments
- id (UUID, PK)
- section_id (UUID, FK)
- student_id (String)
- enrolled_at (DateTime)
- is_active (Boolean)
- role (String, default="student")

## Testing Approach

### Unit Tests
- Service methods tested in isolation
- Mock database sessions
- Test business logic thoroughly

### Integration Tests
- Full API endpoint testing
- Test permission boundaries
- Error response validation

### Manual Testing Scripts
- Created for debugging specific issues
- Helped identify session management problems

## Challenges Overcome

1. **SQLAlchemy DetachedInstanceError**
   - Fixed by ensuring proper session scope
   - Added refresh() calls where needed

2. **Enrollment State Management**
   - Soft delete vs hard delete decision
   - Reactivation logic for re-enrollment

3. **Service Dependencies**
   - Clean separation between section and enrollment services
   - Composition in route handlers

## Files Created/Modified
- `backend/models/course_section.py` (new)
- `backend/services/section_service.py` (new)
- `backend/services/enrollment_service.py` (new)
- `backend/api/teacher_routes.py` (expanded)
- Multiple test files in `tests/`
