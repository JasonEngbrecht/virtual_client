# Current Sprint: Phase 1.5 - Assignment Management

## üìç Session Handoff
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-12 10:30
**Last Completed**: Fixed test failures from Part 6 implementation
**Ready to Start**: Phase 1.5 Part 7 - Student Assignment Viewing
**Tests Passing**: All tests passing ‚úÖ (284 total tests)
**Notes for Next Session**: 
- Parts 1-6 complete: Database models, junction model, service layer, teacher endpoints, publishing, and client management
- Fixed 2 test failures:
  - Added missing computed_field import in assignment.py
  - Fixed test_add_duplicate_client_already_active to use valid rubric

- [ ] Create phase summary

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Database Schema
```sql
-- assignments table
CREATE TABLE assignments (
    id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    section_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'practice', -- 'practice' or 'graded'
    settings JSON,
    available_from TIMESTAMP,
    due_date TIMESTAMP,
    is_published BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    max_attempts INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (section_id) REFERENCES course_sections(id)
);

-- assignment_clients table (junction)
CREATE TABLE assignment_clients (
    id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    assignment_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    client_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    rubric_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    display_order INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (assignment_id) REFERENCES assignments(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (client_id) REFERENCES client_profiles(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (rubric_id) REFERENCES evaluation_rubrics(id),
    UNIQUE(assignment_id, client_id)
);
```

### Key Features to Implement
1. **Assignment Types**: Practice vs Graded modes
2. **Publishing**: Draft vs Published states
3. **Scheduling**: Available from/due dates
4. **Attempts**: Configurable max attempts
5. **Client Pool**: Multiple clients per assignment
6. **Rubric Flexibility**: Different rubric per client

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Patterns to Follow

From Phase 1.4:
- **Service Composition**: Combine services in routes
- **Teacher Isolation**: Filter by section ownership
- **Soft Delete**: For assignment-client associations
- **Efficient Queries**: Avoid N+1 problems
- **Permission Checks**: Use section_service.can_update()

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Assignment model validation
- Service method isolation
- Business rule enforcement

### Integration Tests  
- Full CRUD workflows
- Permission boundaries
- Date/time filtering
- Student access control

### Test Scenarios
1. Create assignment with multiple clients
2. Update assignment (published vs draft)
3. Student can only see published assignments
4. Respect enrollment and date filters
5. Handle timezone considerations

## üß™ Tests to Run

### New Tests Created
- `tests/integration/test_assignment_api.py` - 62 tests total (26 CRUD + 11 publishing + 25 client management)
  ```bash
  python -m pytest tests/integration/test_assignment_api.py -v
  ```
  - TestAssignmentAPI: 26 tests for CRUD operations
  - TestAssignmentPublishing: 11 tests for publish/unpublish endpoints
  - TestAssignmentClientManagement: 25 tests for client management endpoints

### Critical Regression Tests
- Run all tests to ensure no regressions:
  ```bash
  python run_tests.py
  ```
- Total test count should be 284 (222 previous + 62 assignment tests)

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done
- [x] Part 1: Database Models ‚úÖ
- [x] Part 2: Junction Model ‚úÖ
- [x] Part 3: Service Core ‚úÖ
- [x] Part 4: Teacher Endpoints ‚úÖ
- [x] Part 5: Publishing ‚úÖ
- [x] Part 6: Assignment-Client Management ‚úÖ
- [ ] Part 7: Student Assignment Viewing
- [ ] Part 8: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] All tests passing (maintain 80%+ coverage)
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] Phase summary created
- [ ] Ready for Phase 1.6 (Session Management)

## üìö Quick Reference
- **Models**: See `course_section.py` for similar patterns
- **Services**: Copy structure from `section_service.py`
- **Routes**: Follow patterns in `teacher_routes.py`
- **Tests**: Use fixtures from `test_section_api.py`
