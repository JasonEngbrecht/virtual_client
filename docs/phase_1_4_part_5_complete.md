# Phase 1.4 Part 5 - Enrollment Management Endpoints

## Overview
Implemented three teacher endpoints for managing student enrollments in course sections. These endpoints allow teachers to view rosters, enroll students, and manage unenrollments with soft delete functionality.

## Endpoints Implemented

### 1. GET /api/teacher/sections/{section_id}/roster
**Purpose**: View all actively enrolled students in a section

**Response**: List of SectionEnrollment objects
```json
[
  {
    "id": "enrollment-uuid",
    "section_id": "section-uuid",
    "student_id": "student-123",
    "enrolled_at": "2025-05-25T10:00:00",
    "is_active": true,
    "role": "student"
  }
]
```

**Error Codes**:
- 404: Section not found
- 403: Section belongs to another teacher

### 2. POST /api/teacher/sections/{section_id}/enroll
**Purpose**: Enroll a student in a section

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "student_id": "student-123",
  "role": "student"
}
```

**Response**: Created SectionEnrollment object (201)

**Business Rules**:
- No duplicate active enrollments
- Reactivates existing inactive enrollment if found
- Validates section exists before enrolling

**Error Codes**:
- 404: Section not found
- 403: Section belongs to another teacher
- 400: Invalid enrollment data
- 422: Invalid role (must be "student" or "ta")

### 3. DELETE /api/teacher/sections/{section_id}/enroll/{student_id}
**Purpose**: Unenroll a student from a section (soft delete)

**Response**: 204 No Content on success

**Business Rules**:
- Uses soft delete (sets is_active=False)
- Preserves enrollment history
- Only affects active enrollments

**Error Codes**:
- 404: Section not found or student not actively enrolled
- 403: Section belongs to another teacher

## Key Implementation Details

### Service Integration
- Uses `enrollment_service` from Phase 1.4 Part 4
- All business logic handled by the service layer
- Endpoints focus on HTTP concerns and permissions

### Teacher Isolation
- All endpoints check section ownership before operations
- Teachers can only manage enrollments for their own sections
- 403 Forbidden returned for unauthorized access

### Soft Delete Pattern
- Unenrollment doesn't delete records
- Sets `is_active=False` to preserve history
- Re-enrollment reactivates existing records

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages for debugging
- Appropriate HTTP status codes
- User-friendly error descriptions

## Testing

### Integration Tests Created
- `tests/integration/test_enrollment_api.py` with 15 test cases:
  - Empty roster retrieval
  - Student enrollment (success, duplicate, reactivation)
  - Roster viewing with multiple students
  - Unenrollment operations
  - Permission checks (403 errors)
  - Not found scenarios (404 errors)
  - Soft delete verification
  - Invalid data handling (422 errors)

### Test Fixtures Added
- `test_section`: Creates a section for the authenticated teacher
- `test_section_other_teacher`: Creates a section for permission testing
- `test_enrollment`: Pre-created active enrollment
- `test_inactive_enrollment`: Pre-created soft-deleted enrollment

### Manual Test Scripts
- `test_enrollment_endpoints.py`: Tests all endpoints with real HTTP requests
- `test_enrollment_integration.py`: Runs pytest integration tests

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified
- `backend/api/teacher_routes.py`: Added 3 enrollment endpoints
  - Imported enrollment_service and SectionEnrollment models
  - Implemented roster viewing, enrollment, and unenrollment

### Created
- `tests/integration/test_enrollment_api.py`: Comprehensive integration tests
- `tests/integration/conftest.py`: Test fixtures for integration tests
- `test_enrollment_endpoints.py`: Manual endpoint testing script
- `test_enrollment_integration.py`: Pytest runner script

## Usage Examples

### View Section Roster
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/teacher/sections/{section_id}/roster
```

### Enroll a Student
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/teacher/sections/{section_id}/enroll \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"student_id": "student-123", "role": "student"}'
```

### Unenroll a Student
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/teacher/sections/{section_id}/enroll/student-123
```

## Next Steps
- Phase 1.4 Part 6: Student Section Access
  - Add student API routes
  - Implement student authentication mock
  - Create endpoints for students to view their enrolled sections

## Time Summary
- Estimated: 45-60 minutes
- Actual: ~45 minutes
- Status: âœ… Complete
