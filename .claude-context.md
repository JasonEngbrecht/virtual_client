# Quick Context for Claude

**Project**: Virtual Client - Social work training with AI simulations  
**Current Phase**: MVP - Minimum Viable Conversation  
**Language**: Python 3.12 with FastAPI  
**Database**: PostgreSQL (or SQLite for MVP week)  
**LLM**: Anthropic Claude (Haiku for testing, Sonnet for production)  
**Testing**: pytest  
**IDE**: PyCharm on Windows  

## 🎯 Current Task
**PRIORITY**: Railway Deployment for External Testing

**MVP Streamlit Prototype Status**: Parts 1-10 Complete ✅ | Part 11 Pending

**Current Priority**: Deploy to Railway for external user testing
- **Goal**: Get MVP deployed for external testers (~$15-20/month)
- **Strategy**: Single service deployment (FastAPI + 3 Streamlit apps)
- **Timeline**: 45-60 minutes implementation + deployment
- **User Role**: Will handle Railway account creation
- **Git Strategy**: Manual deployments, continue local development

**Deployment Implementation Plan**:
1. **Prepare Deployment Files** (~30 min)
   - Update requirements.txt (Streamlit + PostgreSQL)
   - Create Procfile, railway.json, app_launcher.py
   - Create railway_init.py for database setup
   - Update environment configuration
2. **Railway Setup & Deploy** (~15-30 min)
   - Guide through project creation
   - Configure PostgreSQL addon
   - Set environment variables, deploy
3. **Testing & Documentation** (~15 min)
   - Verify all interfaces work
   - Create deployment docs
   - Prepare for external testers

**After Deployment**: Return to Part 11 - Documentation & Handoff
- Create quick start guide for new users
- Document known issues and limitations  
- Prepare feedback collection template
- Final documentation cleanup
- ~30 minutes estimated

**Day 4-5 Completed (All 10 Parts)**:
- Part 1-10: Full Streamlit prototype with all interfaces ✅
- Teacher Interface: Client creation, conversations, metrics, enhanced features
- Student Interface: Client selection, full conversations
- Admin Dashboard: Real-time monitoring, usage analytics
- Integration: End-to-end workflow, error handling, polish
- Total: ~10 hours implementation, comprehensive test coverage

**Key Implementation Notes from Part 6**:
- Successfully reused conversation patterns from teacher interface
- Proper mocking pattern for Anthropic service: patch `backend.services.conversation_service.anthropic_service`
- Use `side_effect` for multiple mock responses in sequence
- Session duration calculated as: `datetime.now() - st.session_state.conversation_start_time`
- Always check exact field names in models rather than guessing

**Implementation Order**:
1. Part 1: MVP Setup & Basic Infrastructure ✅
2. Part 2: Teacher Interface - Client Form ✅
3. Part 3: Teacher Interface - Test Conversation ✅
4. Part 4: Teacher Interface - Metrics & History ✅
5. Part 5: Student Interface - Client Selection ✅
6. Part 6: Student Interface - Conversation ← **NEXT**
7. Part 7: Admin Dashboard - Basic Metrics
8. Part 8: Admin Dashboard - Enhanced Monitoring
9. Part 9: Polish & Integration Testing
10. Part 10: Documentation & Handoff

**Total Time**: ~8-10 hours across multiple sessions

**Key Features from Day 3**:
- Circuit breaker for API protection
- Cost tracking with alerts ($0.10/$0.50/$10)
- Fallback responses for outages
- Service health monitoring
- All integrated and tested

**Day 1-2 Completed**: All 6 parts of Session & Message Models complete
- Session model simplified for MVP
- Message model with efficient storage
- Session service with full CRUD operations
- Message operations with automatic sequencing
- Token counting utility integrated

**Day 3 Progress - COMPLETE**:
- Part 1 Completed: Anthropic API Setup ✅
- Part 2 Completed: Prompt Generation Service ✅
- Part 3 Completed: Conversation Handler Service ✅
- Part 4 Completed: Rate Limiting ✅
- Part 5 Completed: Error Handling & Robustness ✅
  - Circuit breaker pattern for failure prevention
  - Comprehensive cost tracking and alerts
  - Fallback response system
  - Service health monitoring
- 600 total tests (597 passing, 3 skipped)

## ⚡ Critical MVP Patterns
- Messages in separate table (not JSON) for scale
- Token counting from day 1
- Simple session model (enhance later)
- Streamlit for rapid iteration
- Cost tracking built-in
- Focus on conversation quality

## 🔑 Existing Services to Reuse
```python
# From client_service
get(db, client_id)  # Get client for conversation
get_teacher_clients(db, teacher_id)  # List for testing
create_client_for_teacher(db, client_data, teacher_id)  # Create new client

# From conversation_service
start_conversation(student_id, client_id) -> Session
send_message(session_id, content, user) -> Message
end_conversation(session_id, user) -> Session

# From mvp.utils (implemented)
get_mock_teacher() -> TeacherAuth(id="teacher-1", teacher_id="teacher-1")
get_mock_student() -> StudentAuth(id="student-1", student_id="student-1")
get_database_connection() -> Session
setup_page_config(title, icon, layout)
show_error_message(msg), show_success_message(msg), show_info_message(msg)
format_cost(cost), format_tokens(tokens)
render_chat_message(role, content, tokens)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Start API server (existing)
python start_server.py

# Run Streamlit apps (new) - LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
streamlit run mvp/teacher_test.py
streamlit run mvp/student_practice.py

# Run existing tests
python run_tests.py

# Deploy to Railway (when ready for external testing)
railway up
```

## 📋 MVP Success Checklist
1. [ ] 10+ test conversations
2. [ ] <$0.01 per conversation
3. [ ] 5+ teacher feedback
4. [ ] Conversation quality validated
5. [ ] Technical feasibility proven
6. [ ] Clear Phase 2 requirements

## ⚠️ MVP Constraints
- One client at a time for testing
- No rubric evaluation yet
- Basic UI (Streamlit)
- Manual feedback collection
- Limited to test users
- Local development first (deploy to Railway when ready)
