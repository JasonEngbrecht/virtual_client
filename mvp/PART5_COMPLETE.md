# Part 5: Student Interface - Client Selection ✅

## What Was Built

### 1. Student Practice Interface (`mvp/student_practice.py`)
- **Client Selection View**: Grid layout showing all available clients
- **Client Cards**: Display client name, age, pronouns, scenario preview, and personality traits
- **Session Management**: Detects active sessions and shows "Continue Conversation" vs "Start Conversation"
- **Navigation**: Prepared for conversation view (Part 6)

### 2. Key Features Implemented
- Mock student authentication (`student-1`)
- Fetches clients from database using existing services
- Checks for active sessions per client
- Clean card-based UI with truncated descriptions
- Handles conversation initiation through ConversationService

### 3. Test Created
- `test_student_interface_integration.py`: One comprehensive integration test that verifies:
  - Students can see available clients
  - Can start new conversations
  - Active sessions are properly tracked

## How to Test

### Manual Testing:
```bash
# 1. First ensure you have test data
python mvp/test_student_setup.py

# 2. Run the student interface
streamlit run mvp/student_practice.py

# 3. You should see:
#    - Client cards with information
#    - "Start Conversation" buttons
#    - Any active conversations listed at bottom
```

### Automated Test:
```bash
# Run the integration test
python test_part5.py

# Or directly:
python run_tests.py tests/integration/test_student_interface_integration.py
```

## What's Ready for Part 6
- Session state management set up with `active_session_id` and `selected_client_id`
- View switching logic ready (currently shows placeholder for conversation view)
- All necessary services integrated and working

## Time Taken
- Estimated: 45 minutes
- Actual: ~25 minutes (following MVP approach of building fast)

## Notes
- Used existing patterns from teacher interface
- Leveraged all existing services (no new backend code needed)
- Ready for Part 6: Student conversation interface

## Issues Fixed During Implementation
- Import paths: Changed `backend.models.client` to `backend.models.client_profile`
- Service imports: Changed from class imports to global instances (e.g., `client_service` not `ClientService`)
- Database field names: Fixed multiple field name issues:
  - `client_id` → `client_profile_id` (SessionDB model)
  - `pronouns` → `gender` (ClientProfileDB model)
  - `scenario` → `issues` or `background_story` (field doesn't exist)
  - `created_at` → `started_at` (for session display)
- Test data: Removed ~15 invalid fields from test that don't exist in ClientProfileCreate model
- Conversation service: Updated to use correct parameters (db and student object)

## Valid ClientProfileDB Fields (for reference):
- name, age, gender, race
- socioeconomic_status
- issues (array)
- background_story
- personality_traits (array)
- communication_style
