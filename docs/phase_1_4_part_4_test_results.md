Phase 1.4 Part 4 - Testing Instructions and Results

## Test Status Summary

### Issue Fixed
The SQLAlchemy DetachedInstanceError has been resolved. The problem was that test sections were being created in one database session but their attributes were accessed outside of that session. The fix involved:

1. Storing section IDs as instance variables (`self.section1_id`, `self.section2_id`)
2. Creating sections within a session scope but only using their IDs in tests
3. Ensuring all database operations happen within proper session contexts

### Running Tests

1. **Unit Tests for Enrollment Service**:
```bash
# Run from project root
python test_enrollment_unit.py

# Or directly with pytest
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_enrollment_service.py -v
```

2. **Manual Integration Test**:
```bash
# This demonstrates all features working together
python test_enrollment_service.py
```

3. **Full Test Suite**:
```bash
# Ensure no regressions
python test_quick.py
```

### Expected Results
- All 20 enrollment service tests should now pass
- The manual test script should run without errors
- The full test suite should continue to pass

### Key Features Tested
1. Student enrollment with duplicate prevention
2. Soft delete for unenrollment (preserving history)
3. Enrollment reactivation
4. Section roster management
5. Student section queries
6. Proper handling of invalid sections
7. Active/inactive enrollment filtering

The enrollment service is now ready for integration with API endpoints in Part 5.
