- Used exact field names from models (started_at, total_tokens, estimated_cost, status)
- Proper integration with existing services: session_service, anthropic_service
- Time taken: ~45 minutes (exactly as estimated)
- Auto-refresh works with session state management
- Usage graphs show 24-hour token/cost trends with pandas DataFrames
