# Virtual Client - Continue Development

## 🎯 Start Here:
1. **Read CURRENT_SPRINT.md** - Your immediate task
2. **Check PATTERNS.md** - If you need implementation patterns
3. **Only look at docs/** - If CURRENT_SPRINT explicitly references it
4. **Ignore everything else** - Unless specifically directed

## 📍 Project Location:
`C:\Users\engbrech\Python\virtual_client`

## 🤝 Working Style:
- **Small, incremental changes** - One feature at a time
- **Ask before implementing** - Confirm understanding first
- **Test as you go** - Run tests after each change
- **Update docs as you work** - Don't leave it for later

## 📝 Documentation Rules:
When completing work:
1. **Update CURRENT_SPRINT.md** - Mark tasks complete
2. **Add to PATTERNS.md** - If you establish new patterns
3. **Create phase summary** - Only after ALL parts complete
4. **Keep it focused** - Less is more

## 🚫 What to Ignore:
- `/docs/completed/` - Historical reference only
- Old test scripts in root - Use `run_tests.py`
- Detailed phase documentation - Unless debugging specific issue

## ⚡ Quick Commands:
```bash
# Start server
python start_server.py

# Run tests
python run_tests.py

# Quick test
python test_quick.py
```

## 🔄 Session Handoff:
Before ending session:
1. Commit any changes
2. Update CURRENT_SPRINT.md with progress
3. Note any blockers or questions

**Remember**: Focus on CURRENT_SPRINT.md. Everything else is supporting documentation.
