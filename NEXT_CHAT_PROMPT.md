# Virtual Client Project - Continuation Prompt for Phase 1.4 Part 6

## Project Location and Status
I have a social work training application project located at `C:\Users\engbrech\Python\virtual_client`.

### Current Status:
- **Phase 1.1 COMPLETE**: Database Foundation & Base Service (BaseCRUD, pytest setup)
- **Phase 1.2 COMPLETE**: Full ClientProfile CRUD with authentication, permissions, and error handling (~3.25 hours)
- **Phase 1.3 COMPLETE**: EvaluationRubric CRUD (All 7 Parts COMPLETE) (~3 hours)
- **Phase 1.4 IN PROGRESS**: Course Section Management
  - ✅ Part 1 COMPLETE: Database Models and Schema (25 minutes)
  - ✅ Part 2 COMPLETE: Basic Section Service (30 minutes)
  - ✅ Part 3 COMPLETE: Section CRUD Endpoints (45 minutes)
  - ✅ Part 4 COMPLETE: Enrollment Service Layer (45 minutes)
  - ✅ Part 5 COMPLETE: Enrollment Management Endpoints (45 minutes)
    - GET /api/teacher/sections/{id}/roster
    - POST /api/teacher/sections/{id}/enroll  
    - DELETE /api/teacher/sections/{id}/enroll/{student_id}
    - All endpoints tested and working
    - Fixed typo in unenroll endpoint
  - **Ready for Part 6**: Student Section Access

### Development Environment:
- OS: Windows
- IDE: PyCharm
- Project Path: C:\Users\engbrech\Python\virtual_client
- Python: 3.12 with virtual environment in .venv

## Initial Request
Please first:
1. Review the README.md file to understand the current project state
2. Note that Phase 1.4 Parts 1-5 are complete (models, services, teacher endpoints)
3. Review the Phase 1.4 Part 6 plan in the README
4. Check existing student routes if any exist

## Next Task: Phase 1.4 - Course Section Management - Part 6

Continue with Part 6 of the approved 8-part implementation plan:

### Part 6: Student Section Access (30-45 minutes)
**Goal**: Add student endpoints to view their sections

**Endpoints to implement**:
1. GET /api/student/sections - List enrolled sections
2. GET /api/student/sections/{id} - Get section details

**Implementation steps**:
1. Create/update `backend/api/student_routes.py` 
2. Create mock `get_current_student()` dependency (returns "student-123")
3. Use enrollment_service.get_student_sections() for listing
4. Apply security rules

**Security Rules**:
- Students only see sections they're enrolled in
- Cannot see full roster (no access to other students)
- Cannot modify enrollments (view only)
- 404 for sections they're not enrolled in

**Test Strategy**:
- Integration tests for both endpoints
- Test student isolation (can't see other sections)
- Test proper error codes
- Create mock student fixture

**Key Patterns to Follow**:
- Create new router file if doesn't exist
- Import enrollment_service and section_service
- Similar pattern to teacher routes but view-only
- Use existing models (CourseSection response)
- Write tests in `tests/integration/test_student_section_api.py`

## Important Guidelines
- **Code only what I specifically request**. I prefer to work incrementally with small, focused changes.
- **Before writing code**, always:
  - Confirm you understand what I'm asking for
  - Explain your approach briefly
  - Ask if you should proceed
- **If you have suggestions** for improvements or next steps:
  - List them clearly
  - Explain the benefits
  - Wait for my approval before implementing
- **Keep code changes minimal** - I'd rather build up the project step by step than have large blocks of code all at once
- **Ask clarifying questions** if anything is unclear rather than making assumptions
- **Use Windows file paths** (backslashes) in all file operations
- **Provide Windows command line instructions** when giving terminal commands

Please begin by implementing Part 6 of the Phase 1.4 plan.

## Additional Context
- Mock authentication returns "teacher-123" for teachers
- Mock authentication should return "student-123" for students
- All teacher endpoints are working correctly
- Enrollment service provides needed methods
- Section service can get section details
- Follow the same error handling patterns as teacher routes

## Phase 1.4 Implementation Parts Overview
- ✅ Part 1: Database Models and Schema (25 min) - COMPLETE
- ✅ Part 2: Basic Section Service (30 min) - COMPLETE
- ✅ Part 3: Section CRUD Endpoints (45 min) - COMPLETE
- ✅ Part 4: Enrollment Service Layer (45 min) - COMPLETE
- ✅ Part 5: Enrollment Management Endpoints (45 min) - COMPLETE
- **Part 6: Student Section Access (30-45 min) - START HERE**
- Part 7: Section Summary and Statistics (30-40 min)
- Part 8: Comprehensive Testing & Documentation (45-60 min)

## Files Created/Modified in Previous Parts
- Part 1: Created models in `backend/models/course_section.py`
- Part 2: Created `backend/services/section_service.py`
- Part 3: Added section endpoints to `backend/api/teacher_routes.py`
- Part 4: Created `backend/services/enrollment_service.py`
- Part 5: Added enrollment endpoints to `backend/api/teacher_routes.py`

## Expected Deliverables for Part 6
- New file `backend/api/student_routes.py` with student router
- Two endpoints for viewing sections
- Mock student authentication dependency
- Integration tests for student endpoints
- Proper security isolation
- Update to `backend/app.py` to include student router
