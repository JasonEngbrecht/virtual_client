Phase 1.4 Part 4 - Fixed Test Summary

## Issue Resolution

The enrollment service tests were failing with "Section not found" errors because the test sections were being created in a different database session than the one used in the test methods.

### Problem
- `setup_method` was creating sections using `db_service.get_db()` 
- Test methods were receiving a `db_session` from pytest fixture
- These were different database sessions, so sections weren't visible

### Solution
- Converted test sections to a pytest fixture (`test_sections`)
- This fixture uses the same `db_session` that's passed to test methods
- All database operations now happen in the same session context

### Changes Made
1. Created `@pytest.fixture test_sections(db_session)` that returns section objects
2. Created `@pytest.fixture student_ids()` for consistent student IDs
3. Removed `setup_method` and `teardown_method` (pytest handles cleanup)
4. Updated all test methods to accept fixtures as parameters

### Key Learning
When using pytest with SQLAlchemy, ensure all database operations in a test use the same session. Creating data in setup methods with a different session will lead to "not found" errors.

The manual test script works because it consistently uses the same session throughout its execution.
