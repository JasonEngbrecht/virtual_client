# Virtual Client Project - Continuation Prompt

## Project Location and Status
I have a social work training application project located at `C:\Users\engbrech\Python\virtual_client`.

**Current Status:**
* Phase 1.1 COMPLETE: Database Foundation & Base Service (BaseCRUD, pytest setup)
* Phase 1.2 COMPLETE: Full ClientProfile CRUD with authentication, permissions, and error handling (~3.25 hours)
* Phase 1.3 COMPLETE: EvaluationRubric CRUD (All 7 Parts COMPLETE) (~3 hours)
   * ✅ Part 1: Basic RubricService class created
   * ✅ Part 2: Teacher-filtered methods implemented
   * ✅ Part 3: GET /api/teacher/rubrics endpoint 
   * ✅ Part 4: All CRUD endpoints (POST, GET/{id}, PUT/{id}, DELETE/{id})
   * ✅ Part 5: Cascade protection (409 Conflict for rubrics in use)
   * ✅ Part 6: Enhanced validation with user-friendly error messages
   * ✅ Part 7: Comprehensive test suite (`test_phase_1_3_complete.py`)
* Phase 1.4 IN PROGRESS: Course Section Management
   * ✅ Part 1 COMPLETE: Database Models and Schema (25 minutes)
     - Created `CourseSectionDB` and `SectionEnrollmentDB` models
     - Created all Pydantic schemas (Create, Update, Response)
     - All 15 unit tests passing in `test_course_section.py`
     - Database tables verified and working
   * ✅ Part 2 COMPLETE: Basic Section Service (30 minutes)
     - Created `backend/services/section_service.py`
     - Implemented SectionService with teacher-specific methods
     - All 11 unit tests passing in `test_section_service.py`
     - Permission system implemented (can_update, can_delete)
   * Ready for Part 3: Section CRUD Endpoints

**Development Environment:**
* **OS**: Windows
* **IDE**: PyCharm
* **Project Path**: `C:\Users\engbrech\Python\virtual_client`
* **Python**: 3.12 with virtual environment in `.venv`

## Initial Request
**Please first:**
1. Review the README.md file to understand the current project state
2. Note that Phase 1.4 Parts 1-2 are complete (models and service)
3. Review the Phase 1.4 Part 3 plan in the README

## Next Task: Phase 1.4 - Course Section Management - Part 3
Continue with Part 3 of the approved 8-part implementation plan:

**Part 3: Section CRUD Endpoints (45-60 minutes)**
* Add endpoints to `backend/api/teacher_routes.py`
* Implement the following endpoints:
  - GET `/api/teacher/sections` - list teacher's sections
  - POST `/api/teacher/sections` - create new section
  - GET `/api/teacher/sections/{id}` - get section details
  - PUT `/api/teacher/sections/{id}` - update section
  - DELETE `/api/teacher/sections/{id}` - delete section
* Follow the same error handling patterns from client and rubric endpoints
* Write integration tests for each endpoint
* Test validation rules and cascade prevention

**Key Patterns to Follow:**
* Use the existing `section_service` from Part 2
* Apply the same authentication dependency (`get_current_teacher`)
* Follow error handling patterns (404, 403, 400, 422)
* Teacher isolation - verify ownership before updates/deletes
* Write integration tests alongside implementation

## Important Guidelines
* **Code only what I specifically request**. I prefer to work incrementally with small, focused changes.
* **Before writing code**, always:
   * Confirm you understand what I'm asking for
   * Explain your approach briefly
   * Ask if you should proceed
* **If you have suggestions** for improvements or next steps:
   * List them clearly
   * Explain the benefits
   * Wait for my approval before implementing
* **Keep code changes minimal** - I'd rather build up the project step by step than have large blocks of code all at once
* **Ask clarifying questions** if anything is unclear rather than making assumptions
* **Use Windows file paths** (backslashes) in all file operations
* **Provide Windows command line instructions** when giving terminal commands

Please begin by implementing Part 3 of the Phase 1.4 plan.

## Additional Context
* All tests are currently passing:
  - 15 database/foundation tests
  - ClientProfile: unit + integration tests
  - EvaluationRubric: 29 tests (unit + integration)
  - CourseSection: 15 unit tests (Part 1)
  - SectionService: 11 unit tests (Part 2)
  - Phase completion tests: `test_phase_1_2_complete.py`, `test_phase_1_3_complete.py`
* The incremental development approach has been successful:
  - Phase 1.2: 6 parts (~3.25 hours)
  - Phase 1.3: 7 parts (~3 hours)
  - Phase 1.4: Parts 1-2 complete (55 min), 6 parts remaining
* Mock authentication is in place (returns "teacher-123" and "student-456")
* All CRUD operations follow consistent patterns with teacher isolation
* Enhanced error handling provides user-friendly messages
* The project uses dependency injection for database and authentication
* Circular import issue was resolved by removing service imports from `backend/services/__init__.py`
