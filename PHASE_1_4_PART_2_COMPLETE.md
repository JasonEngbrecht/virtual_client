# Phase 1.4 Part 2 - Complete Summary

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Created Section Service (`backend/services/section_service.py`)

**SectionService Class:**
- Inherits from `BaseCRUD[CourseSectionDB]` for consistent CRUD operations
- Follows the same patterns established in ClientService and RubricService
- Provides teacher-specific section management

**Methods Implemented:**
1. `get_teacher_sections()` - Retrieves all sections for a specific teacher
   - Uses BaseCRUD's `get_multi()` with teacher_id filter
   - Supports pagination with skip/limit parameters

2. `create_section_for_teacher()` - Creates a new section with teacher assignment
   - Accepts CourseSectionCreate schema
   - Automatically assigns the teacher_id
   - Returns the created section

3. `can_update()` - Permission check for updates
   - Returns True only if the teacher owns the section
   - Returns False for non-owners or non-existent sections

4. `can_delete()` - Permission check for deletions
   - Currently uses same logic as can_update
   - Ready for future differentiation (e.g., admin overrides)

### 2. Created Comprehensive Unit Tests (`tests/unit/test_section_service.py`)

**Test Coverage:**
- Service instantiation and inheritance verification
- Global service instance availability
- `get_teacher_sections()` with proper filtering
- `create_section_for_teacher()` with teacher assignment
- Permission checks for both owner and non-owner scenarios
- Edge cases (non-existent sections)

**Total Tests:** 11 test cases covering all methods and scenarios

### 3. Created Verification Script (`test_section_service.py`)

A standalone script that:
- Tests service instantiation
- Creates test sections
- Verifies teacher filtering
- Tests permission checks
- Performs updates
- Cleans up test data

## Key Implementation Details

1. **Consistent Patterns**: The service follows the exact same patterns as ClientService and RubricService for familiarity and maintainability

2. **Teacher Isolation**: All methods ensure teachers can only access/modify their own sections

3. **BaseCRUD Inheritance**: Leverages the generic CRUD operations, adding only teacher-specific logic

4. **Clean Architecture**: Service layer remains independent of API concerns

## Testing Instructions

### Run Unit Tests
```bash
# From project root
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_section_service.py -v

# Or run all unit tests
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v
```

### Run Verification Script
```bash
# From project root
python test_section_service.py
```

### Expected Output
- All 11 unit tests should pass
- Verification script should show all operations working correctly
- No errors or warnings

## What's Ready for Part 3

The section service is now fully implemented and tested, providing:
- A solid foundation for the API endpoints
- Teacher-specific operations with proper isolation
- Permission checking for secure operations
- Full CRUD capabilities through BaseCRUD inheritance

## Files Created/Modified

1. **Created:** `backend/services/section_service.py` (91 lines)
2. **Created:** `tests/unit/test_section_service.py` (265 lines)
3. **Created:** `test_section_service.py` (verification script, 105 lines)
4. **No modifications** to `__init__.py` (avoiding circular imports)

## Next Step: Part 3 - Section CRUD Endpoints

Add the following endpoints to `backend/api/teacher_routes.py`:
- GET `/api/teacher/sections` - List teacher's sections
- POST `/api/teacher/sections` - Create new section
- GET `/api/teacher/sections/{id}` - Get section details
- PUT `/api/teacher/sections/{id}` - Update section
- DELETE `/api/teacher/sections/{id}` - Delete section

Each endpoint will use the section_service methods with proper error handling and teacher authentication.
