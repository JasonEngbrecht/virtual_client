# Phase 1.3: EvaluationRubric CRUD Implementation

**Completed**: ~3 hours | **Status**: âœ… Complete

## Overview
Implemented full CRUD API for evaluation rubrics with enhanced validation, cascade protection, and user-friendly error messages.

## What Was Built

### Service Layer (`backend/services/rubric_service.py`)
- `RubricService` class extending BaseCRUD
- Criteria weight validation
- Duplicate name checking
- Cascade protection (`is_rubric_in_use`)
- Teacher isolation

### API Endpoints (added to `backend/api/teacher_routes.py`)
- GET `/api/teacher/rubrics` - List teacher's rubrics
- POST `/api/teacher/rubrics` - Create rubric with validation
- GET `/api/teacher/rubrics/{id}` - Get rubric details
- PUT `/api/teacher/rubrics/{id}` - Update rubric (partial support)
- DELETE `/api/teacher/rubrics/{id}` - Delete with cascade check

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Enhanced Validation**
   - Weights must sum to 1.0 (with tolerance)
   - No negative weights
   - No duplicate criterion names
   - User-friendly error messages with actual values

2. **Cascade Protection**
   - Prevents deletion of rubrics in use by sessions
   - Returns 409 Conflict with clear explanation

3. **Complex Data Structure**
   - Nested criteria with evaluation points
   - Weight-based scoring system
   - Flexible criterion count

## Implementation Timeline

| Part | Description | Time |
|------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Basic Rubric Service | 20 min |
| 2 | Teacher-Filtered Methods | 40 min |
| 3 | First API Endpoint | 25 min |
| 4 | Remaining CRUD Endpoints | 50 min |
| 5 | Cascade Protection | 35 min |
| 6 | Enhanced Validation | 25 min |
| 7 | Comprehensive Testing | 20 min |
| **Total** | **Phase 1.3 Complete** | **~3 hours** |

## Key Patterns Extended

### Validation with Helpful Messages
```python
@validator('criteria')
def validate_weights_sum(cls, criteria):
    total = sum(c.weight for c in criteria)
    if not 0.999 <= total <= 1.001:  # Float tolerance
        weights_str = ", ".join([f"{c.name}: {c.weight}" for c in criteria])
        raise ValueError(
            f"Criteria weights must sum to exactly 1.0, but your weights sum to {total:.3f}. "
            f"Current weights: {{{weights_str}}}. "
            f"Please adjust the weights so they total 1.0 (100% of the evaluation)."
        )
    return criteria
```

### Service-Level Business Logic
```python
def create_rubric_for_teacher(self, db: Session, rubric: EvaluationRubricCreate, teacher_id: str):
    # Check for duplicate criterion names
    criterion_names = [c.name.lower() for c in rubric.criteria]
    duplicates = [name for name in criterion_names if criterion_names.count(name) > 1]
    
    if duplicates:
        unique_duplicates = list(set(duplicates))
        raise ValueError(
            f"Each criterion must have a unique name. "
            f"Found duplicate criterion names: {', '.join(unique_duplicates)}. "
            f"Please use distinct names for each evaluation criterion."
        )
```

### Cascade Protection Pattern
```python
def is_rubric_in_use(self, db: Session, rubric_id: str) -> bool:
    from backend.models.session import SessionDB
    count = db.query(SessionDB).filter(
        SessionDB.rubric_id == rubric_id
    ).count()
    return count > 0
```

## Validation Examples

### Weight Sum Error
**Before**: "Criteria weights must sum to 1.0, got 0.8"
**After**: "Criteria weights must sum to exactly 1.0, but your weights sum to 0.800. Current weights: {Communication: 0.3, Empathy: 0.5}. Please adjust the weights so they total 1.0 (100% of the evaluation)."

### Negative Weight Error
**Before**: "ensure this value is greater than or equal to 0"
**After**: "Criterion weight cannot be negative. You provided -0.5, but weights must be between 0.0 and 1.0"

### Cascade Protection
**Error**: "Cannot delete rubric with id 'xyz'. This rubric is being used by one or more sessions. Please end or reassign those sessions first."

## Test Coverage
- 29 rubric-related tests all passing
- Unit tests for service methods
- Integration tests for all endpoints
- Validation edge cases
- Cascade protection scenarios

## Files Created/Modified
- `backend/services/rubric_service.py` (new)
- `backend/api/teacher_routes.py` (expanded)
- `backend/models/rubric.py` (enhanced validation)
- Multiple test files

## Complex Features Handled
1. Nested data structures (criteria within rubrics)
2. Float precision for weight calculations
3. Detailed validation messages
4. Referential integrity protection
5. Partial updates maintaining consistency
