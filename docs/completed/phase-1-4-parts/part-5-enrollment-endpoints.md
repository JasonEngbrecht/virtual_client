# Phase 1.4 Part 5 - Enrollment Management Endpoints

**Completed**: 45 minutes | **Status**: ✅ Complete

## Overview
Implemented three teacher endpoints for managing student enrollments in course sections. These endpoints allow teachers to view rosters, enroll students, and manage unenrollments with soft delete functionality.

## Endpoints Implemented

### 1. GET /api/teacher/sections/{section_id}/roster
**Purpose**: View all actively enrolled students in a section

**Response**: List of SectionEnrollment objects
```json
[
  {
    "id": "enrollment-uuid",
    "section_id": "section-uuid",
    "student_id": "student-123",
    "enrolled_at": "2025-05-25T10:00:00",
    "is_active": true,
    "role": "student"
  }
]
```

**Error Codes**:
- 404: Section not found
- 403: Section belongs to another teacher

### 2. POST /api/teacher/sections/{section_id}/enroll
**Purpose**: Enroll a student in a section

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "student_id": "student-123",
  "role": "student"
}
```

**Response**: Created SectionEnrollment object (201)

**Business Rules**:
- No duplicate active enrollments
- Reactivates existing inactive enrollment if found
- Validates section exists before enrolling

**Error Codes**:
- 404: Section not found
- 403: Section belongs to another teacher
- 400: Invalid enrollment data
- 422: Invalid role (must be "student" or "ta")

### 3. DELETE /api/teacher/sections/{section_id}/enroll/{student_id}
**Purpose**: Unenroll a student from a section (soft delete)

**Response**: 204 No Content on success

**Business Rules**:
- Uses soft delete (sets is_active=False)
- Preserves enrollment history
- Only affects active enrollments

**Error Codes**:
- 404: Section not found or student not actively enrolled
- 403: Section belongs to another teacher

## Key Implementation Details

### Service Integration
```python
# All business logic delegated to enrollment_service
roster = enrollment_service.get_section_roster(db, section_id)
enrollment = enrollment_service.enroll_student(db, section_id, enrollment_data.student_id, enrollment_data.role)
success = enrollment_service.unenroll_student(db, section_id, student_id)
```

### Teacher Isolation Pattern
```python
# Check ownership before any operation
if not section_service.can_update(db, section_id, teacher_id):
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=403,
        detail="You don't have permission to manage enrollments for this section"
    )
```

### Bug Fix During Implementation
Fixed typo in unenroll endpoint: `return Nones` → `return None`
- This was causing 500 errors even though database operations succeeded
- Highlighted importance of testing return statements

## Testing

### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/test_enrollment_api.py`)
Created 15 comprehensive test cases:
- Empty roster retrieval
- Student enrollment (success, duplicate, reactivation)
- Roster viewing with multiple students
- Unenrollment operations
- Permission checks (403 errors)
- Not found scenarios (404 errors)
- Soft delete verification
- Invalid data handling (422 errors)

### Test Fixtures Created (`tests/integration/conftest.py`)
- `test_section`: Creates a section for the authenticated teacher
- `test_section_other_teacher`: Creates a section for permission testing
- `test_enrollment`: Pre-created active enrollment
- `test_inactive_enrollment`: Pre-created soft-deleted enrollment

### Manual Testing Instructions

#### Prerequisites
1. Ensure database has course section tables:
   ```bash
   python -m backend.scripts.init_db
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn backend.app:app --reload
   ```

#### Testing Methods

**Option 1: Automated Manual Test**
```bash
python test_enrollment_endpoints.py
```
This script tests all endpoints and provides clear pass/fail results.

**Option 2: Individual Endpoint Testing**
```bash
# Create section
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/teacher/sections -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"name\": \"Test Section\"}"

# View roster
curl http://localhost:8000/api/teacher/sections/{SECTION_ID}/roster

# Enroll student
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/teacher/sections/{SECTION_ID}/enroll -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"student_id\": \"student-001\", \"role\": \"student\"}"

# Unenroll student
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/teacher/sections/{SECTION_ID}/enroll/student-001
```

### Test Results
- ✅ All manual tests passing (10/10 in test script)
- ✅ Enrollment workflow fully tested and working
- ✅ Soft delete preserving history as designed
- ✅ Re-enrollment reactivation working correctly

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified
- `backend/api/teacher_routes.py`: Added 3 enrollment endpoints (~120 lines)

### Created
- `tests/integration/test_enrollment_api.py`: Integration test suite (350+ lines)
- `tests/integration/conftest.py`: Test fixtures for enrollments
- `test_enrollment_endpoints.py`: Manual testing script (180+ lines)
- `test_enrollment_integration.py`: Pytest runner script

## API Documentation
New endpoints appear in Swagger UI at http://localhost:8000/docs:
- Can test interactively
- Shows request/response schemas
- Documents all error codes

## Key Patterns Followed
- Service layer for business logic (enrollment_service)
- Teacher authentication and isolation
- Soft delete for history preservation
- Comprehensive error handling (404, 403, 400, 422)
- RESTful API design principles
- Consistent with existing client and rubric endpoints

## Time Summary
- **Estimated**: 45-60 minutes
- **Actual**: ~45 minutes (within estimate)
- **Total Phase 1.4 Progress**: 235 minutes (~3.9 hours)

## Next Steps
Ready for Phase 1.4 Part 6: Student Section Access
- Create student API routes
- Implement view-only endpoints for students
- Add student authentication mock
- Ensure proper security isolation
