# Quick Context for Claude

**Project**: Virtual Client - Social work training with AI simulations  
**Current Phase**: 1.4 Part 6 - Student Section Access  
**Language**: Python 3.12 with FastAPI  
**Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy  
**Testing**: pytest  
**IDE**: PyCharm on Windows  

## 🎯 Current Task
Implementing student endpoints to view enrolled sections (read-only).

**Key Files**:
- To Create: `backend/api/student_routes.py`
- To Create: `tests/integration/test_student_section_api.py`
- Reference: `backend/api/teacher_routes.py` (for patterns)
- Uses: `enrollment_service`, `section_service`

## ⚡ Critical Patterns
- Mock auth returns `"student-123"`
- Use 404 NOT 403 for student endpoints (security)
- Students can only see their enrolled sections
- No update/delete operations for students
- Check enrollment before showing section details

## 🔑 Key Services Available
```python
# From enrollment_service
get_student_sections(db, student_id)  # List enrolled sections
is_student_enrolled(db, section_id, student_id)  # Check enrollment

# From section_service  
get(db, section_id)  # Get section details
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Start server
python start_server.py

# Run new tests (after creating)
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_student_section_api.py -v

# Quick regression test
python test_quick.py
```

## 📋 Implementation Checklist
1. [ ] Create student router with mock auth
2. [ ] Add GET /api/student/sections endpoint
3. [ ] Add GET /api/student/sections/{id} endpoint  
4. [ ] Write integration tests
5. [ ] Register router in app.py
6. [ ] Run all tests
7. [ ] Update documentation per COMPLETE_CHAT_PROMPT.md
