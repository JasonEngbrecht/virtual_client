# Current Sprint: Phase 1.4 Part 6 - Student Section Access

## 📍 Session Handoff
**Last Updated**: 2024-12-19
**Last Completed**: Documentation reorganization (PATTERNS.md by category, DATA_MODELS.md created)
**Ready to Start**: Phase 1.4 Part 6 - Student Section Access implementation
**Tests Passing**: All tests passing ✅
**Notes for Next Session**: Documentation structure complete, ready for student routes implementation

## 📍 Where We Are in the Journey
- **Current Phase**: 1.4 Course Section Management (Parts 1-5 ✅, Part 6 in progress)
- **Next Part**: Part 7 - Section Statistics  
- **Next Phase**: 1.5 Assignment Management
- **Overall Progress**: ~53% of Phase 1 complete (12.4 of 23-28 hours)
- **See**: [`PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`](PROJECT_ROADMAP.md) for full context

**Status**: Ready to Start | **Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

## 🎯 Sprint Goal
Add student endpoints to view their enrolled sections (read-only access).

## 📋 Tasks
1. [ ] Create `backend/api/student_routes.py` with student router
2. [ ] Implement mock `get_current_student()` dependency
3. [ ] Add GET `/api/student/sections` endpoint
4. [ ] Add GET `/api/student/sections/{id}` endpoint
5. [ ] Write integration tests
6. [ ] Update `backend/app.py` to include student router

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### New File: `backend/api/student_routes.py`
```python
# Create router similar to teacher_routes.py structure
# Import: enrollment_service, section_service
# Mock auth returns: "student-123"
```

### Endpoints to Implement

#### 1. GET `/api/student/sections`
- **Purpose**: List all sections student is enrolled in
- **Service Method**: `enrollment_service.get_student_sections(db, student_id)`
- **Returns**: List of CourseSection objects
- **Security**: Only returns sections where student is actively enrolled

#### 2. GET `/api/student/sections/{id}`
- **Purpose**: Get details of a specific enrolled section
- **Service Method**: 
  - Check enrollment: `enrollment_service.is_student_enrolled(db, section_id, student_id)`
  - Get details: `section_service.get(db, section_id)`
- **Returns**: CourseSection object or 404
- **Security**: 404 if student not enrolled (don't reveal section exists)

## ⚠️ Key Patterns to Follow

**Authentication** → PATTERNS.md: "Mock Authentication Pattern"
**Router Setup** → PATTERNS.md: "Standard CRUD Routes"
**Error Handling** → PATTERNS.md: "Standard Error Responses"
**Service Usage** → Use existing enrollment_service and section_service

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

Create `tests/integration/test_student_section_api.py`:
1. Test student can list their enrolled sections
2. Test student can get details of enrolled section
3. Test student gets 404 for non-enrolled section
4. Test empty list when no enrollments
5. Test student can't see full roster

## ❌ What NOT to Do
- Don't create update/delete endpoints (view only)
- Don't expose enrollment counts or other students
- Don't return 403 errors (use 404 for security)
- Don't modify existing services

## ✅ Definition of Done
- [ ] Both endpoints working with mock auth
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Student can only see their own sections
- [ ] Proper 404 responses for non-enrolled sections
- [ ] App includes student router

## 📚 Quick Reference
- **Mock authentication pattern**: See PATTERNS.md
- **Service examples**: See PATTERNS.md "Service Layer Architecture"
- **Error handling**: See PATTERNS.md "Standard Error Responses"
- **Router structure**: Check teacher_routes.py for example

## ✅ Tests to Run
**After implementing Part 6**:
- `python -m pytest tests/integration/test_student_section_api.py -v` (new - create this)
- `python -m pytest tests/integration/test_enrollment_api.py -v` (regression)
- `python -m pytest tests/integration/test_section_api.py -v` (regression)
- `python test_quick.py` (general smoke test)

**If any failures occur**:
1. Fix the issue
2. Re-run the specific failing test
3. Run `python run_tests.py` for full validation
4. Document any persistent issues in Session Handoff
