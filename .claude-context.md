# Quick Context for Claude

**Project**: Virtual Client - Social work training with AI simulations  
**Current Phase**: MVP - Minimum Viable Conversation  
**Language**: Python 3.12 with FastAPI  
**Database**: PostgreSQL (or SQLite for MVP week)  
**LLM**: Anthropic Claude (Haiku for testing, Sonnet for production)  
**Testing**: pytest  
**IDE**: PyCharm on Windows  

## 🎯 Current Task
MVP Week 1 Day 3: Anthropic Integration

**Next steps**:
- Set up Anthropic API connection
- Create prompt generation from client profiles
- Implement conversation handler service
- Add rate limiting and error handling
- Test with various client personalities

**Day 1-2 Completed**: All 6 parts of Session & Message Models complete
- Session model simplified for MVP
- Message model with efficient storage
- Session service with full CRUD operations
- Message operations with automatic sequencing
- Token counting utility integrated
- 401 total tests, all passing

## ⚡ Critical MVP Patterns
- Messages in separate table (not JSON) for scale
- Token counting from day 1
- Simple session model (enhance later)
- Streamlit for rapid iteration
- Cost tracking built-in
- Focus on conversation quality

## 🔑 Existing Services to Reuse
```python
# From client_service
get(db, client_id)  # Get client for conversation
get_teacher_clients(db, teacher_id)  # List for testing

# From auth (mock for now)
get_current_teacher() -> TeacherAuth
get_current_student() -> StudentAuth
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Start API server (existing)
python start_server.py

# Run Streamlit apps (new) - LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
streamlit run mvp/teacher_test.py
streamlit run mvp/student_practice.py

# Run existing tests
python run_tests.py

# Deploy to Railway (when ready for external testing)
railway up
```

## 📋 MVP Success Checklist
1. [ ] 10+ test conversations
2. [ ] <$0.01 per conversation
3. [ ] 5+ teacher feedback
4. [ ] Conversation quality validated
5. [ ] Technical feasibility proven
6. [ ] Clear Phase 2 requirements

## ⚠️ MVP Constraints
- One client at a time for testing
- No rubric evaluation yet
- Basic UI (Streamlit)
- Manual feedback collection
- Limited to test users
- Local development first (deploy to Railway when ready)
