# Virtual Client - Social Work Training App

**Status:** In Development | **Phase:** 1 - Foundation

This project will create a virtual client that social work (and other areas) can interface with to practice working with clients.

## Project Overview

An educational application designed to help social work students practice client interactions through AI-powered simulations. The app allows teachers to create virtual clients with specific demographics and issues, upload evaluation rubrics, and enables students to engage in realistic practice sessions with automated feedback.

## Development Environment

This project is being developed using **PyCharm IDE**.

### PyCharm Configuration
1. Open the project in PyCharm
2. Configure the Python interpreter to use the virtual environment
3. Set up run configurations for FastAPI
4. Configure code style and linting preferences

For detailed setup instructions, run: `python setup_instructions.py`

## Core Features

### 1. Teacher Capabilities
- **Virtual Client Creation**
  - Set client demographics (age, race, gender, socioeconomic status)
  - Select from predefined issues/challenges
  - Customize personality traits and communication styles
  - Generate background stories

- **Rubric Management**
  - Upload custom evaluation rubrics
  - Define evaluation criteria with weights
  - Set scoring levels and expectations
  - Save and reuse rubrics across sessions

### 2. Student Capabilities
- **Interactive Sessions**
  - Chat-based interface with virtual client
  - Realistic client responses powered by LLM
  - Session recording and transcript generation
  - Practice mode with different client scenarios

## Key Technical Decisions

### LLM Prompt Strategy
The system will use structured prompts that include:
1. Client profile information
2. Personality and communication style guidelines
3. Current emotional state tracking
4. Conversation history context
5. Realistic behavior instructions

### Evaluation Approach
Two-tier evaluation system:
1. **Automated Analysis**: Keyword detection, interaction patterns, conversation flow
2. **LLM-Assisted**: Using LLM to evaluate against rubric criteria with specific examples

### Session Management
- Sessions stored as complete transcripts
- Real-time state management for active sessions
- Ability to pause and resume sessions
- Export functionality for review

## Important Considerations

### Educational Value
- Ensure realistic but appropriate client behaviors
- Balance challenge with learning objectives
- Provide constructive feedback
- Support iterative learning

### Technical Considerations
- API rate limiting for LLM calls
- Session data privacy and storage
- Scalability for multiple concurrent users
- Response time optimization

### Safety & Ethics
- Content filtering for inappropriate interactions
- Clear educational context boundaries
- Sensitivity to represented demographics
- Instructor oversight capabilities

### Future Enhancements
- Multiple language support
- Voice interaction capabilities
- Video avatar integration
- Peer review features
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Mobile application
- Integration with LMS systems
