- **Next Phase**: 1.5 Assignment Management
- **Overall Progress**: ~58% of Phase 1 complete (13.4 of 23 hours minimum)
- **See**: [`PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`](PROJECT_ROADMAP.md) for full context

**Status**: Complete ✅ | **Actual Time**: 35 minutes

## 🎯 Sprint Goal
Add statistics endpoints for teachers to view enrollment counts and section status.

## 📋 Tasks
1. [x] Add `get_section_stats()` method to `section_service.py` ✅
2. [x] Add `get_all_sections_stats()` method to `section_service.py` ✅
3. [x] Add GET `/api/teacher/sections/stats` endpoint ✅
4. [x] Add GET `/api/teacher/sections/{id}/stats` endpoint ✅
5. [x] Write integration tests ✅
6. [x] Ensure efficient SQL queries (no N+1 problems) ✅

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Service Methods to Add

#### 1. section_service.get_section_stats()
```python
def get_section_stats(self, db: Session, section_id: str) -> dict:
    """
    Get enrollment statistics for a single section.
    
    Returns:
        {
            "section_id": str,
            "active_enrollments": int,
            "inactive_enrollments": int,
            "total_enrollments": int
        }
    """
```

#### 2. section_service.get_all_sections_stats()
```python
def get_all_sections_stats(self, db: Session, teacher_id: str) -> List[dict]:
    """
    Get enrollment statistics for all teacher's sections.
    Uses efficient SQL to avoid N+1 queries.
    
    Returns:
        List of stats dictionaries with section info
    """
```

### Endpoints to Implement

#### 1. GET `/api/teacher/sections/stats`
- **Purpose**: Get statistics for all teacher's sections
- **Returns**: List of sections with enrollment counts
- **Example Response**:
```json
[
    {
        "section_id": "uuid",
        "name": "SW 101 - Fall 2025",
        "active_enrollments": 25,
        "inactive_enrollments": 3,
        "total_enrollments": 28
    }
]
```

#### 2. GET `/api/teacher/sections/{id}/stats`
- **Purpose**: Get detailed statistics for a specific section
- **Returns**: Single section statistics
- **Security**: 404 if section doesn't exist or belongs to another teacher

## ⚠️ Key Patterns to Follow

**Efficient Queries** → Use SQL COUNT() and GROUP BY
**Security** → Teacher can only see their own sections' stats
**Zero Handling** → Return 0 counts for sections with no enrollments
**Response Format** → Include section metadata with stats

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

Create `tests/integration/test_section_stats_api.py`:
1. Test stats for section with enrollments
2. Test stats for section with no enrollments
3. Test bulk stats endpoint
4. Test 404 for non-existent section
5. Test 403 for other teacher's section
6. Test inactive enrollment counting

## ❌ What NOT to Do
- Don't load all enrollments into memory (use SQL aggregation)
- Don't expose individual student information
- Don't create N+1 query problems
- Don't include sensitive data in stats

## ✅ Definition of Done
- [x] Both stats endpoints working ✅
- [x] Efficient SQL queries (single query for bulk stats) ✅
- [x] Integration tests passing ✅
- [x] Proper error handling ✅
- [x] Zero counts handled correctly ✅

## 📚 Quick Reference
- **SQL aggregation**: Use COUNT() with GROUP BY
- **Service pattern**: See section_service.py
- **Error handling**: See PATTERNS.md "Standard Error Responses"
- **Testing pattern**: See existing section API tests

## ✅ Tests to Run
**After implementing Part 7**:
- `python -m pytest tests/integration/test_section_stats_api.py -v` (new)
- `python -m pytest tests/integration/test_section_api.py -v` (regression)
- `python test_quick.py` (general smoke test)

**If any failures occur**:
1. Fix the issue
2. Re-run the specific failing test
3. Document any persistent issues in Session Handoff
