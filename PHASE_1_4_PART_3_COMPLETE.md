# Phase 1.4 Part 3 Complete - Section CRUD Endpoints

## Overview
Successfully implemented all 5 CRUD endpoints for course section management in the teacher API.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. API Endpoints Added to `backend/api/teacher_routes.py`

All endpoints follow the established patterns from client and rubric endpoints:

1. **GET `/api/teacher/sections`** - List all sections for authenticated teacher
   - Returns only sections created by the current teacher
   - Uses `section_service.get_teacher_sections()`
   
2. **POST `/api/teacher/sections`** - Create new section
   - Validates section data using Pydantic schemas
   - Automatically assigns teacher_id from authentication
   - Returns 201 with created section
   
3. **GET `/api/teacher/sections/{id}`** - Get specific section
   - Returns 404 if section not found
   - Returns 403 if section belongs to another teacher
   - Uses teacher_id check for authorization
   
4. **PUT `/api/teacher/sections/{id}`** - Update section
   - Supports partial updates (only provided fields)
   - Uses `section_service.can_update()` for permission check
   - Returns 400 if no valid fields provided
   
5. **DELETE `/api/teacher/sections/{id}`** - Delete section
   - Uses `section_service.can_delete()` for permission check
   - Cascades to delete related enrollments
   - Returns 204 No Content on success

### 2. Error Handling

Consistent error responses across all endpoints:
- **404 Not Found**: Clear messages with resource ID
- **403 Forbidden**: Permission denied for other teachers' sections
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid or empty update data
- **422 Unprocessable Entity**: Pydantic validation errors
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Safe error messages

### 3. Integration Tests Created

`tests/integration/test_section_api.py` with comprehensive test coverage:
- Empty list tests
- Create with full and minimal data
- Validation error tests
- Teacher isolation tests
- Update (full and partial) tests
- Delete cascade tests
- Complete workflow test

### 4. Test Scripts

Created helper scripts for testing:
- `test_section_endpoints.py` - Manual API testing script
- `run_section_tests.py` - Integration test runner

## Key Implementation Details

### Security Through Teacher Isolation
- All operations filtered by teacher_id from authentication
- Permission checks using service layer methods
- No cross-teacher data access possible

### Consistent Patterns
- Same error handling as client/rubric endpoints
- Dependency injection for database and auth
- RESTful conventions followed

### Cascade Behavior
- Deleting a section cascades to delete all enrollments
- Documented in DELETE endpoint description

## Testing Instructions

### Run Integration Tests
```bash
python run_section_tests.py
# or
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_section_api.py -v
```

### Manual API Testing
```bash
# Start the server
python -m uvicorn backend.app:app --reload

# In another terminal
python test_section_endpoints.py
```

## Files Modified/Created

1. **Modified**: `backend/api/teacher_routes.py`
   - Added imports for section models and service
   - Added 5 new endpoints (approximately 230 lines)

2. **Created**: `tests/integration/test_section_api.py` (397 lines)
   - Comprehensive integration tests
   - Tests all CRUD operations
   - Tests error cases and permissions

3. **Created**: `test_section_endpoints.py` (181 lines)
   - Manual testing script
   - Tests all endpoints with sample data
   - Tests error handling

4. **Created**: `run_section_tests.py` (23 lines)
   - Quick test runner for integration tests

## Time Taken
Approximately 45 minutes (within the 45-60 minute estimate)

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed with Phase 1.4 Part 4 - Enrollment Service Layer

## Verification
All endpoints are working correctly with:
- ✅ Proper authentication using mock teacher
- ✅ Teacher isolation enforced
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Integration tests passing
- ✅ Follows established patterns
