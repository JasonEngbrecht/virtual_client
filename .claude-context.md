# Quick Context for Claude

**Project**: Virtual Client - Social work training with AI simulations  
**Current Phase**: 1.5 - Assignment Management  
**Language**: Python 3.12 with FastAPI  
**Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy  
**Testing**: pytest  
**IDE**: PyCharm on Windows  

## 🎯 Current Task
Phase 1.5 Part 8: Testing & Documentation - Run full test suite, fix any regressions, update API documentation, and create phase summary.

**Key Files**:
- To Update: API documentation (if needed)
- To Create: `docs/completed/phase-1-5-assignment-management.md` (phase summary)
- Reference: All assignment-related files for documentation
- Reference: `tests/integration/test_assignment_api.py` (62 tests)
- Reference: `tests/integration/test_student_assignment_api.py` (15 tests)
- Run: Full test suite to ensure no regressions

## ⚡ Critical Patterns
- Assignments belong to sections (which belong to teachers)
- Assignment-Client is many-to-many with rubric per pair
- Practice vs Graded assignment types
- Published vs Draft states
- Available from/due date filtering
- Soft delete for assignment-client associations

## 🔑 Key Services Available
```python
# From section_service
get(db, section_id)  # Get section details
can_update(db, section_id, teacher_id)  # Permission check

# From client_service
get(db, client_id)  # Get client details
get_teacher_clients(db, teacher_id)  # List teacher's clients

# From rubric_service
get(db, rubric_id)  # Get rubric details
get_teacher_rubrics(db, teacher_id)  # List teacher's rubrics

# From enrollment_service
is_student_enrolled(db, section_id, student_id)  # Check enrollment
```
