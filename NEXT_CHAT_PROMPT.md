# Virtual Client Project - Continuation Prompt

## Project Location and Status
I have a social work training application project located at `C:\Users\engbrech\Python\virtual_client`.

**Current Status:**
* Phase 1.1 COMPLETE: Database Foundation & Base Service (BaseCRUD, pytest setup)
* Phase 1.2 COMPLETE: Full ClientProfile CRUD with authentication, permissions, and error handling
* Phase 1.3 COMPLETE: EvaluationRubric CRUD (All 7 Parts COMPLETE)
   * ✅ Part 1: Basic RubricService class created
   * ✅ Part 2: Teacher-filtered methods implemented
   * ✅ Part 3: GET /api/teacher/rubrics endpoint 
   * ✅ Part 4: All CRUD endpoints (POST, GET/{id}, PUT/{id}, DELETE/{id})
   * ✅ Part 5: Cascade protection (409 Conflict for rubrics in use)
   * ✅ Part 6: Enhanced validation with user-friendly error messages
   * ✅ Part 7: Comprehensive test suite (`test_phase_1_3_complete.py`)
* Ready to begin Phase 1.4: Session Management

**Development Environment:**
* **OS**: Windows
* **IDE**: PyCharm
* **Project Path**: `C:\Users\engbrech\Python\virtual_client`
* **Python**: 3.12 with virtual environment in `.venv`

## Initial Request
**Please first:**
1. Review the README.md file to understand the project architecture and current status
2. Check the completed Phase 1 implementations:
   * `backend/services/client_service.py` - ClientProfile CRUD
   * `backend/services/rubric_service.py` - EvaluationRubric CRUD
   * `backend/api/teacher_routes.py` - All teacher endpoints
   * `backend/models/` - All data models
   * `tests/` - Comprehensive test coverage
3. Review the Phase 1.4 plan for Session Management

## Next Task: Phase 1.4 - Session Management Planning
Begin planning the Session Management implementation:
* Review the Session model in `backend/models/session.py`
* Design the session service architecture
* Plan the incremental implementation approach (similar to Phases 1.2 and 1.3)
* Consider:
  - Session creation and lifecycle management
  - Message handling (student/client interactions)
  - Session state management (active, paused, ended)
  - Integration with existing client profiles and rubrics
  - Both teacher and student access patterns

## Important Guidelines
* **Code only what I specifically request**. I prefer to work incrementally with small, focused changes.
* **Before writing code**, always:
   * Confirm you understand what I'm asking for
   * Explain your approach briefly
   * Ask if you should proceed
* **If you have suggestions** for improvements or next steps:
   * List them clearly
   * Explain the benefits
   * Wait for my approval before implementing
* **Keep code changes minimal** - I'd rather build up the project step by step than have large blocks of code all at once
* **Ask clarifying questions** if anything is unclear rather than making assumptions
* **Use Windows file paths** (backslashes) in all file operations
* **Provide Windows command line instructions** when giving terminal commands

Please begin by reviewing the current project state and suggesting an incremental implementation plan for Phase 1.4.

## Additional Context
* All tests are currently passing:
  - 15 database/foundation tests
  - ClientProfile: unit + integration tests
  - EvaluationRubric: 29 tests (unit + integration)
  - Phase completion tests: `test_phase_1_2_complete.py`, `test_phase_1_3_complete.py`
* The incremental development approach has been successful:
  - Phase 1.2: 6 parts (~3.25 hours)
  - Phase 1.3: 7 parts (~3 hours)
* Mock authentication is in place (returns "teacher-123")
* All CRUD operations follow consistent patterns with teacher isolation
* Enhanced error handling provides user-friendly messages
* The project uses dependency injection for database and authentication
