# Phase 1.2 Part 3 - Fix Applied âœ…

## Issue Found and Fixed

### Problem
The `/api/teacher/test-db` endpoint was returning a 500 Internal Server Error due to a type validation error:
```
fastapi.exceptions.ResponseValidationError: 1 validation errors:
  {'type': 'string_type', 'loc': ('response', 'db_connected'), 'msg': 'Input should be a valid string', 'input': True}
```

### Cause
The endpoint's return type was annotated as `Dict[str, str]` (all string values), but we were returning:
```python
{
    "message": "Database connection is working!",
    "status": "ok",
    "db_connected": True  # Boolean, not string!
}
```

### Solution
Changed the return type annotation from `Dict[str, str]` to `Dict[str, Any]` to allow mixed types in the response.

## Testing the Fix

Restart the server and try again:
```bash
python start_server.py
```

Or test directly:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/teacher/test-db
```

Expected response:
```json
{
    "message": "Database connection is working!",
    "status": "ok",
    "db_connected": true
}
```

## Lesson Learned
When using FastAPI, be careful with type annotations - they're enforced at runtime! Use `Any` for mixed-type dictionaries or create proper Pydantic response models.
