## 🎯 Current Task
MVP Week 1 Day 4-5: Streamlit Prototype - Part 4 of 10 Ready

**Day 3 Completed**: All 5 parts of Anthropic Integration complete ✅
**Day 4-5 Progress**: 
- Part 1 Completed ✅: MVP Setup & Basic Infrastructure
  - Created mvp/ directory with all files
  - Implemented comprehensive utils.py
  - Fixed auth models and SQL queries
  - Added 19 tests for utilities
- Part 2 Completed ✅: Teacher Interface - Client Form
  - Full client creation form with validation
  - Save functionality integrated with database
  - Display saved clients with expandable details
  - Added 13 tests (all passing)
- Part 3 Completed ✅: Teacher Interface - Test Conversation
  - Full chat interface with real-time messaging
  - Token counting and cost tracking
  - Session management (start/end conversations)
  - Fixed all AttributeError issues
  - Added 22 tests (all passing)
  - Environment configuration pattern implemented

**Ready to Start**: Part 4 - Teacher Interface - Metrics & History
- Add conversation history viewer
- Show total tokens and cost
- Add "Export Conversation" button
- Create metrics summary (avg response time, total cost)
- ~45 minutes estimated

**Implementation Order**:
1. Part 1: MVP Setup & Basic Infrastructure ✅
2. Part 2: Teacher Interface - Client Form ✅
3. Part 3: Teacher Interface - Test Conversation ✅
4. Part 4: Teacher Interface - Metrics & History ← **NEXT**
5. Part 5: Student Interface - Client Selection
6. Part 6: Student Interface - Conversation
7. Part 7: Admin Dashboard - Basic Metrics
8. Part 8: Admin Dashboard - Enhanced Monitoring
9. Part 9: Polish & Integration Testing
10. Part 10: Documentation & Handoff

**Total Time**: ~8-10 hours across multiple sessions

**Key Features from Day 3**:
- Circuit breaker for API protection
- Cost tracking with alerts ($0.10/$0.50/$10)
- Fallback responses for outages
- Service health monitoring
- All integrated and tested

**Day 1-2 Completed**: All 6 parts of Session & Message Models complete
- Session model simplified for MVP
- Message model with efficient storage
- Session service with full CRUD operations
- Message operations with automatic sequencing
- Token counting utility integrated

**Day 3 Progress - COMPLETE**:
- Part 1 Completed: Anthropic API Setup ✅
- Part 2 Completed: Prompt Generation Service ✅
- Part 3 Completed: Conversation Handler Service ✅
- Part 4 Completed: Rate Limiting ✅
- Part 5 Completed: Error Handling & Robustness ✅
  - Circuit breaker pattern for failure prevention
  - Comprehensive cost tracking and alerts
  - Fallback response system
  - Service health monitoring
- 600 total tests (597 passing, 3 skipped)

## ⚡ Critical MVP Patterns
- Messages in separate table (not JSON) for scale
- Token counting from day 1
- Simple session model (enhance later)
- Streamlit for rapid iteration
- Cost tracking built-in
- Focus on conversation quality

## 🔑 Existing Services to Reuse
```python
# From client_service
get(db, client_id)  # Get client for conversation
get_teacher_clients(db, teacher_id)  # List for testing
create_client_for_teacher(db, client_data, teacher_id)  # Create new client

# From conversation_service
start_conversation(student_id, client_id) -> Session
send_message(session_id, content, user) -> Message
end_conversation(session_id, user) -> Session

# From mvp.utils (implemented)
get_mock_teacher() -> TeacherAuth(id="teacher-1", teacher_id="teacher-1")
get_mock_student() -> StudentAuth(id="student-1", student_id="student-1")
get_database_connection() -> Session
setup_page_config(title, icon, layout)
show_error_message(msg), show_success_message(msg), show_info_message(msg)
format_cost(cost), format_tokens(tokens)
render_chat_message(role, content, tokens)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Start API server (existing)
python start_server.py

# Run Streamlit apps (new) - LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
streamlit run mvp/teacher_test.py
streamlit run mvp/student_practice.py

# Run existing tests
python run_tests.py

# Deploy to Railway (when ready for external testing)
railway up
```

## 📋 MVP Success Checklist
1. [ ] 10+ test conversations
2. [ ] <$0.01 per conversation
3. [ ] 5+ teacher feedback
4. [ ] Conversation quality validated
5. [ ] Technical feasibility proven
6. [ ] Clear Phase 2 requirements

## ⚠️ MVP Constraints
- One client at a time for testing
- No rubric evaluation yet
- Basic UI (Streamlit)
- Manual feedback collection
- Limited to test users
- Local development first (deploy to Railway when ready)
