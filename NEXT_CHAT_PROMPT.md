# Virtual Client Project - Continuation Prompt

## Project Location and Status
I have a social work training application project located at `C:\Users\engbrech\Python\virtual_client`.

**Current Status:**
* Phase 1.1 COMPLETE: Database Foundation & Base Service (BaseCRUD, pytest setup)
* Phase 1.2 COMPLETE: Full ClientProfile CRUD with authentication, permissions, and error handling
* Phase 1.3 COMPLETE: EvaluationRubric CRUD (All 7 Parts COMPLETE)
   * ✅ Part 1: Basic RubricService class created
   * ✅ Part 2: Teacher-filtered methods implemented
   * ✅ Part 3: GET /api/teacher/rubrics endpoint 
   * ✅ Part 4: All CRUD endpoints (POST, GET/{id}, PUT/{id}, DELETE/{id})
   * ✅ Part 5: Cascade protection (409 Conflict for rubrics in use)
   * ✅ Part 6: Enhanced validation with user-friendly error messages
   * ✅ Part 7: Comprehensive test suite (`test_phase_1_3_complete.py`)
* Phase 1.4 IN PROGRESS: Course Section Management
   * ✅ Part 1 COMPLETE: Database Models and Schema (25 minutes)
     - Created `CourseSectionDB` and `SectionEnrollmentDB` models
     - Created all Pydantic schemas (Create, Update, Response)
     - All 15 unit tests passing in `test_course_section.py`
     - Database tables verified and working
   * Ready for Part 2: Basic Section Service

**Development Environment:**
* **OS**: Windows
* **IDE**: PyCharm
* **Project Path**: `C:\Users\engbrech\Python\virtual_client`
* **Python**: 3.12 with virtual environment in `.venv`

## Initial Request
**Please first:**
1. Review the README.md file to understand the current project state
2. Note that Phase 1.4 Part 1 is complete (database models)
3. Review the Phase 1.4 Part 2 plan in the README

## Next Task: Phase 1.4 - Course Section Management - Part 2
Continue with Part 2 of the approved 8-part implementation plan:

**Part 2: Basic Section Service (30-40 minutes)**
* Create `backend/services/section_service.py`
* Implement SectionService class inheriting from BaseCRUD
* Add teacher-specific methods:
  - `get_teacher_sections()` - filter sections by teacher
  - `create_section_for_teacher()` - create with teacher assignment
  - `can_update()` - permission check
  - `can_delete()` - permission check
* Write unit tests for each method
* Follow the same patterns established in ClientService and RubricService

**Key Patterns to Follow:**
* Inherit from BaseCRUD for consistent CRUD operations
* Use the same permission checking pattern as ClientService/RubricService
* Teacher isolation - teachers only see/modify their own sections
* Write unit tests before/with implementation

## Important Guidelines
* **Code only what I specifically request**. I prefer to work incrementally with small, focused changes.
* **Before writing code**, always:
   * Confirm you understand what I'm asking for
   * Explain your approach briefly
   * Ask if you should proceed
* **If you have suggestions** for improvements or next steps:
   * List them clearly
   * Explain the benefits
   * Wait for my approval before implementing
* **Keep code changes minimal** - I'd rather build up the project step by step than have large blocks of code all at once
* **Ask clarifying questions** if anything is unclear rather than making assumptions
* **Use Windows file paths** (backslashes) in all file operations
* **Provide Windows command line instructions** when giving terminal commands

Please begin by implementing Part 2 of the Phase 1.4 plan.

## Additional Context
* All tests are currently passing:
  - 15 database/foundation tests
  - ClientProfile: unit + integration tests
  - EvaluationRubric: 29 tests (unit + integration)
  - CourseSection: 15 unit tests (Part 1 complete)
  - Phase completion tests: `test_phase_1_2_complete.py`, `test_phase_1_3_complete.py`
* The incremental development approach has been successful:
  - Phase 1.2: 6 parts (~3.25 hours)
  - Phase 1.3: 7 parts (~3 hours)
  - Phase 1.4: Part 1 complete (25 min), 7 parts remaining
* Mock authentication is in place (returns "teacher-123" and "student-456")
* All CRUD operations follow consistent patterns with teacher isolation
* Enhanced error handling provides user-friendly messages
* The project uses dependency injection for database and authentication
* Circular import issue was resolved by removing service imports from `backend/services/__init__.py`

## Phase 1.4 Implementation Parts Overview
