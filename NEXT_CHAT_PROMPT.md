# Virtual Client Project - Continuation Prompt for Phase 1.4 Part 5

## Project Location and Status
I have a social work training application project located at `C:\Users\engbrech\Python\virtual_client`.

### Current Status:
- **Phase 1.1 COMPLETE**: Database Foundation & Base Service (BaseCRUD, pytest setup)
- **Phase 1.2 COMPLETE**: Full ClientProfile CRUD with authentication, permissions, and error handling (~3.25 hours)
- **Phase 1.3 COMPLETE**: EvaluationRubric CRUD (All 7 Parts COMPLETE) (~3 hours)
  - ✅ All CRUD endpoints with cascade protection
  - ✅ Enhanced validation with user-friendly error messages
  - ✅ Comprehensive test suite (29 tests)
- **Phase 1.4 IN PROGRESS**: Course Section Management
  - ✅ Part 1 COMPLETE: Database Models and Schema (25 minutes)
  - ✅ Part 2 COMPLETE: Basic Section Service (30 minutes)
  - ✅ Part 3 COMPLETE: Section CRUD Endpoints (45 minutes)
  - ✅ Part 4 COMPLETE: Enrollment Service Layer (45 minutes)
    - Implemented all enrollment service methods
    - Soft delete pattern for enrollment history
    - 20 unit tests all passing
    - Fixed SQLAlchemy session management issues
  - **Ready for Part 5: Enrollment Management Endpoints**

### Development Environment:
- OS: Windows
- IDE: PyCharm
- Project Path: C:\Users\engbrech\Python\virtual_client
- Python: 3.12 with virtual environment in .venv

## Initial Request
Please first:
1. Review the README.md file to understand the current project state
2. Note that Phase 1.4 Parts 1-4 are complete (models, services, section CRUD, enrollment service)
3. Review the Phase 1.4 Part 5 plan in the README
4. Check the enrollment service implementation in `backend/services/enrollment_service.py`

## Next Task: Phase 1.4 - Course Section Management - Part 5

Continue with Part 5 of the approved 8-part implementation plan:

### Part 5: Enrollment Management Endpoints (45-60 minutes)

**Goal**: Add teacher endpoints for managing enrollments

**Endpoints to implement**:
1. GET `/api/teacher/sections/{id}/roster` - View enrolled students
2. POST `/api/teacher/sections/{id}/enroll` - Enroll a student  
3. DELETE `/api/teacher/sections/{id}/enroll/{student_id}` - Unenroll student

**Business Rules**:
- Teachers can only manage enrollments for their own sections
- Use enrollment service methods for all operations
- Return appropriate error codes (404, 403, 400)
- Include enrollment details in roster response

**Test Strategy**:
- Integration tests for each endpoint
- Test teacher isolation (403 for other teachers' sections)
- Test error cases (invalid section, student already enrolled)
- Test soft delete behavior

### Key Patterns to Follow:
- Add endpoints to existing `backend/api/teacher_routes.py`
- Use the enrollment service created in Part 4
- Apply teacher authentication dependency
- Follow error handling patterns from previous endpoints
- Write integration tests in `tests/integration/test_enrollment_api.py`

## Important Guidelines
1. **Code only what I specifically request**. I prefer to work incrementally with small, focused changes.
2. **Before writing code**, always:
   - Confirm you understand what I'm asking for
   - Explain your approach briefly
   - Ask if you should proceed
3. **If you have suggestions** for improvements or next steps:
   - List them clearly
   - Explain the benefits
   - Wait for my approval before implementing
4. **Keep code changes minimal** - I'd rather build up the project step by step than have large blocks of code all at once
5. **Ask clarifying questions** if anything is unclear rather than making assumptions
6. **Use Windows file paths** (backslashes) in all file operations
7. **Provide Windows command line instructions** when giving terminal commands

Please begin by implementing Part 5 of the Phase 1.4 plan.

## Additional Context
- All tests are currently passing, including the 20 enrollment service tests
- Mock authentication is in place (returns "teacher-123")
- All CRUD operations follow consistent patterns with teacher isolation
- Enhanced error handling provides user-friendly messages
- The project uses dependency injection for database and authentication
- The enrollment service provides all the business logic needed for the endpoints

### Phase 1.4 Implementation Parts Overview
- ✅ Part 1: Database Models and Schema (25 min) - COMPLETE
- ✅ Part 2: Basic Section Service (30 min) - COMPLETE
- ✅ Part 3: Section CRUD Endpoints (45 min) - COMPLETE
- ✅ Part 4: Enrollment Service Layer (45 min) - COMPLETE
- **Part 5: Enrollment Management Endpoints (45-60 min) - START HERE**
- Part 6: Student Section Access (30-45 min)
- Part 7: Section Summary and Statistics (30-40 min)
- Part 8: Comprehensive Testing & Documentation (45-60 min)

### Files Created/Modified in Previous Parts
- Part 1: Created models in `backend/models/course_section.py`
- Part 2: Created `backend/services/section_service.py`
- Part 3: Added section endpoints to `backend/api/teacher_routes.py`
- Part 4: Created `backend/services/enrollment_service.py` with comprehensive enrollment management

## Expected Deliverables for Part 5
1. Three new endpoints in teacher_routes.py for enrollment management
2. Integration tests for all three endpoints
3. Proper error handling and teacher isolation
4. Use of the enrollment service for all business logic
5. Consistent patterns with existing endpoints
