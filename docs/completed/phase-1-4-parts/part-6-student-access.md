# Phase 1.4 Part 6: Student Section Access

**Duration**: 45 minutes | **Status**: âœ… Complete

## Overview
Implemented read-only endpoints for students to view their enrolled sections. This provides students with access to their course information while maintaining strict security boundaries.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created Student Router
**File**: `backend/api/student_routes.py`

```python
router = APIRouter(
    prefix="/student",
    tags=["student"],
    responses={404: {"description": "Not found"}},
)
```

### 2. Authentication Dependency
Created mock authentication similar to teacher routes:
```python
async def get_current_student() -> str:
    """Mock student authentication - returns 'student-456'"""
    return "student-456"
```

### 3. Endpoints Implemented

#### GET /api/student/sections
- Lists all sections where student is actively enrolled
- Filters out inactive enrollments
- Returns section details including teacher info

#### GET /api/student/sections/{section_id}
- Gets details for a specific enrolled section
- Returns 404 if:
  - Section doesn't exist
  - Student is not enrolled
  - Enrollment is inactive
- No modification capabilities

### 4. Security Implementation

**Read-Only Access**:
- No POST, PUT, or DELETE endpoints
- Cannot modify sections or enrollments
- Cannot see other students' data

**Enrollment Verification**:
```python
# Check if student is enrolled
enrollment = enrollment_service.get_enrollment(
    db, section_id, student_id
)
if not enrollment or not enrollment.is_active:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404)
```

### 5. Integration with Services

Leveraged existing services:
- `enrollment_service.get_student_sections()` - Get enrolled sections
- `enrollment_service.get_enrollment()` - Verify enrollment
- `section_service.get()` - Get section details

## Testing

### Test Coverage
Created 11 comprehensive integration tests in `test_student_section_api.py`:

1. **List Operations**:
   - List enrolled sections
   - Empty list when no enrollments
   - Inactive enrollments filtered out

2. **Detail Operations**:
   - Get enrolled section details
   - 404 for non-enrolled sections
   - 404 for non-existent sections
   - 404 for inactive enrollments

3. **Security Tests**:
   - No update operations allowed
   - No delete operations allowed
   - No create operations allowed
   - Cannot access teacher roster endpoint

### Key Test Pattern
```python
def test_inactive_enrollments_not_shown():
    # Create enrollment
    enrollment = enroll_student(...)
    
    # Deactivate it
    enrollment.is_active = False
    
    # Verify not in list
    response = client.get("/api/student/sections")
    assert len(response.json()) == 0
```

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Route Registration
**Issue**: Student routes not accessible
**Solution**: Register router in app.py:
```python
app.include_router(student_router, prefix="/api")
```

### Challenge 2: Enrollment State
**Issue**: Showing inactive enrollments
**Solution**: Added is_active filter in service layer

### Challenge 3: Error Consistency
**Issue**: Different error codes for various "not found" scenarios
**Solution**: Standardized on 404 for all access denials

## Key Decisions

1. **404 vs 403**: Used 404 for non-enrolled sections to avoid revealing section existence
2. **No Roster Access**: Students cannot see classmates for privacy
3. **Include Teacher Info**: Students can see teacher_id in section details
4. **Active Only**: Inactive enrollments completely hidden

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `backend/api/student_routes.py` - Student API endpoints
- `tests/integration/test_student_section_api.py` - Integration tests

### Modified
- `backend/app.py` - Added router registration
- `backend/services/__init__.py` - Added student router import

## Patterns Established

### Student Access Pattern
```python
# Student can only access their enrolled sections
sections = enrollment_service.get_student_sections(
    db, student_id, include_inactive=False
)
```

### Security Through 404
```python
# Don't reveal section existence to non-enrolled students
if not enrollment or not enrollment.is_active:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=404,
        detail="Section not found"
    )
```

## Metrics
- **Lines of Code**: ~100 in routes, ~200 in tests
- **Test Coverage**: 100% of student routes
- **Endpoints**: 2 (both read-only)
- **Security Tests**: 4 (preventing all write operations)

## Conclusion
Successfully implemented secure, read-only access for students to view their enrolled sections. The implementation maintains strict security boundaries while providing necessary functionality for students to access their course information.
