# Virtual Client Project - Continuation Prompt

## Project Location and Status

I have a social work training application project located at `C:\Users\engbrech\Python\virtual_client`.

### Current Status:

- **Phase 1.1 COMPLETE**: Database Foundation & Base Service (BaseCRUD, pytest setup)
- **Phase 1.2 COMPLETE**: Full ClientProfile CRUD with authentication, permissions, and error handling (~3.25 hours)
- **Phase 1.3 COMPLETE**: EvaluationRubric CRUD (All 7 Parts COMPLETE) (~3 hours)
  - ✅ All CRUD endpoints with cascade protection
  - ✅ Enhanced validation with user-friendly error messages
  - ✅ Comprehensive test suite (29 tests)
- **Phase 1.4 IN PROGRESS**: Course Section Management
  - ✅ Part 1 COMPLETE: Database Models and Schema (25 minutes)
  - ✅ Part 2 COMPLETE: Basic Section Service (30 minutes)
  - ✅ Part 3 COMPLETE: Section CRUD Endpoints (45 minutes)
    - All 5 CRUD endpoints implemented
    - 18 integration tests passing
    - Teacher isolation and error handling
  - **Ready for Part 4: Enrollment Service Layer**

### Development Environment:

- OS: Windows
- IDE: PyCharm
- Project Path: `C:\Users\engbrech\Python\virtual_client`
- Python: 3.12 with virtual environment in `.venv`

## Initial Request

Please first:

1. Review the README.md file to understand the current project state
2. Note that Phase 1.4 Parts 1-3 are complete (models, service, and CRUD endpoints)
3. Review the Phase 1.4 Part 4 plan in the README

## Next Task: Phase 1.4 - Course Section Management - Part 4

Continue with Part 4 of the approved 8-part implementation plan:

**Part 4: Enrollment Service Layer (45-60 minutes)**

1. Create `backend/services/enrollment_service.py`
2. Implement the following methods:
   - `enroll_student()` - Add student to section
   - `unenroll_student()` - Soft delete enrollment
   - `get_section_roster()` - Get all active enrollments
   - `is_student_enrolled()` - Check enrollment status
   - `get_student_sections()` - Get sections for a student

3. Business Rules:
   - No duplicate enrollments (student can't enroll twice in same section)
   - Soft delete for unenrollment (set is_active=False)
   - Only active enrollments count
   - Maintain enrolled_at timestamp

4. Write comprehensive unit tests for the service

### Key Patterns to Follow:

- Use the existing patterns from client, rubric, and section services
- The service should work with the SectionEnrollmentDB model
- Apply proper error handling and validation
- Write unit tests alongside implementation
- Follow the incremental approach - test each method as you implement it

## Important Guidelines

- **Code only what I specifically request**. I prefer to work incrementally with small, focused changes.
- **Before writing code**, always:
  - Confirm you understand what I'm asking for
  - Explain your approach briefly
  - Ask if you should proceed
- **If you have suggestions** for improvements or next steps:
  - List them clearly
  - Explain the benefits
  - Wait for my approval before implementing
- **Keep code changes minimal** - I'd rather build up the project step by step than have large blocks of code all at once
- **Ask clarifying questions** if anything is unclear rather than making assumptions
- **Use Windows file paths** (backslashes) in all file operations
- **Provide Windows command line instructions** when giving terminal commands

Please begin by implementing Part 4 of the Phase 1.4 plan.

## Additional Context

- All tests are currently passing:
  - 15 database/foundation tests
  - ClientProfile: unit + integration tests
  - EvaluationRubric: 29 tests (unit + integration)
  - CourseSection: 15 unit tests (Part 1)
  - SectionService: 11 unit tests (Part 2)
  - Section API: 18 integration tests (Part 3)
  - Phase completion tests: test_phase_1_2_complete.py, test_phase_1_3_complete.py

- The incremental development approach has been successful:
  - Phase 1.2: 6 parts (~3.25 hours)
  - Phase 1.3: 7 parts (~3 hours)
  - Phase 1.4: Parts 1-3 complete (100 min), 5 parts remaining

- Mock authentication is in place (returns "teacher-123" and "student-456")
- All CRUD operations follow consistent patterns with teacher isolation
- Enhanced error handling provides user-friendly messages
- The project uses dependency injection for database and authentication
- Circular import issue was resolved by removing service imports from backend/services/__init__.py

## Phase 1.4 Implementation Parts Overview

- ✅ Part 1: Database Models and Schema (25 min) - COMPLETE
- ✅ Part 2: Basic Section Service (30 min) - COMPLETE
- ✅ Part 3: Section CRUD Endpoints (45 min) - COMPLETE
- **Part 4: Enrollment Service Layer (45-60 min) - START HERE**
- Part 5: Enrollment Management Endpoints (45-60 min)
- Part 6: Student Section Access (30-45 min)
- Part 7: Section Summary and Statistics (30-40 min)
- Part 8: Comprehensive Testing & Documentation (45-60 min)
