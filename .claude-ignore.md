# Files and Directories to Ignore During Development

This file helps Claude (and developers) know what to skip during normal development tasks.

## ðŸš« Ignore These Unless Specifically Needed:

### Directories
- `/.git/` - Version control
- `/.idea/` - PyCharm settings  
- `/.pytest_cache/` - Test cache
- `/__pycache__/` - Python cache
- `/database/` - SQLite files (except schema.sql)
- `/docs/completed/` - Historical docs (reference only)
- `/docs/decisions/` - Past decisions (reference only)

### Files in Root
- `.env` - Sensitive configuration
- `pytest.ini` - Test configuration
- `quick_setup.bat` - One-time setup
- `setup_instructions.py` - One-time setup

### Test Files (use run_tests.py instead)
- Individual test runner scripts
- Manual test scripts (unless debugging)
- Test debugging files:
  - `DIAGNOSE_TESTS.py`
  - `RUN_THIS_TO_TEST.py`
  - `CHECK_TESTS.py`
  - `test_*.py` in root (except test_quick.py)
  - `run_*_test.py`
  - `debug_*.py`
  - `TEST_DEBUG_GUIDE.md`
  - `TEST_FIXES_SUMMARY.md`
  - `scripts/test_*.py` (manual test scripts)

## âœ… Focus On These:

### For Current Work
1. `.claude-context.md` - Quick task overview
2. `CURRENT_SPRINT.md` - Detailed requirements
3. `PATTERNS.md` - Implementation patterns
4. Files mentioned in CURRENT_SPRINT

### For Environment/Testing
- `ENVIRONMENT.md` - System setup and commands
- `run_tests.py` - Main test runner
- `tests/TESTING_GUIDE.md` - How to write and run tests
- `tests/` directory - When writing new tests

### For Context (only if needed)
- `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` - Strategic vision
- `DATA_MODELS.md` - Model reference

### For API Work  
- `backend/api/` - Route definitions
- `backend/services/` - Business logic
- `backend/models/` - Data models

### For Session End
- `COMPLETE_CHAT_PROMPT.md` - Documentation update checklist

## ðŸ“‹ When to Look at Historical Docs:

Only consult `/docs/completed/` when:
- CURRENT_SPRINT explicitly references it
- Debugging an issue with existing functionality  
- Need to understand a complex pattern's origin
- Extending existing functionality

## ðŸ’¡ Remember:

**Default assumption**: If it's not in CURRENT_SPRINT.md or PATTERNS.md, you probably don't need it for the current task.

**Goal**: Read 3 files or less to start any task:
1. CURRENT_SPRINT.md
2. PATTERNS.md (if needed)
3. The file you're working on
