# Virtual Client Project - Continuation Prompt

## Project Location and Status
I have a social work training application project located at `C:\Users\engbrech\Python\virtual_client`.

**Current Status:**
* Phase 1.1 COMPLETE: Database Foundation & Base Service (BaseCRUD, pytest setup)
* Phase 1.2 COMPLETE: Full ClientProfile CRUD with authentication, permissions, and error handling
* Phase 1.3 IN PROGRESS: EvaluationRubric CRUD (Parts 1-6 of 7 COMPLETE)
   * ✅ Part 1: Basic RubricService class created
   * ✅ Part 2: Teacher-filtered methods implemented (get_teacher_rubrics, create_rubric_for_teacher, can_update, can_delete)
   * ✅ Part 3: GET /api/teacher/rubrics endpoint added with integration test
   * ✅ Part 4: All CRUD endpoints implemented (POST, GET/{id}, PUT/{id}, DELETE/{id})
   * ✅ Part 5: Cascade protection implemented (is_rubric_in_use method, 409 Conflict response)
   * ✅ Part 6: Enhanced validation & error handling with user-friendly messages
   * Ready to continue with Part 7

**Development Environment:**
* **OS**: Windows
* **IDE**: PyCharm
* **Project Path**: `C:\Users\engbrech\Python\virtual_client`
* **Python**: 3.12 with virtual environment in `.venv`

## Initial Request
**Please first:**
1. Review the README.md file to understand the project architecture and Phase 1.3 plan
2. Check the current implementation in:
   * `backend/services/rubric_service.py` (Parts 1-2 + Part 5 + Part 6 duplicate validation)
   * `backend/api/teacher_routes.py` (Parts 3-5 - all CRUD endpoints with cascade protection)
   * `backend/models/rubric.py` (Part 6 - enhanced validation messages)
   * `tests/unit/test_rubric_service.py` (8 tests passing including cascade tests)
   * `tests/integration/test_rubric_api.py` (comprehensive tests for all endpoints including 409 conflicts)
3. Review the Phase 1.3 incremental plan (7 parts total)

## Next Task: Phase 1.3 Part 7 - Comprehensive Test Suite
Create a comprehensive test suite that verifies all rubric functionality:
* Create `test_phase_1_3_complete.py` script
* Test all endpoints with various scenarios
* Verify teacher isolation works correctly
* Test edge cases (empty criteria, invalid weights, etc.)
* Ensure all 7 parts work together seamlessly

## Important Guidelines
* **Code only what I specifically request**. I prefer to work incrementally with small, focused changes.
* **Before writing code**, always:
   * Confirm you understand what I'm asking for
   * Explain your approach briefly
   * Ask if you should proceed
* **If you have suggestions** for improvements or next steps:
   * List them clearly
   * Explain the benefits
   * Wait for my approval before implementing
* **Keep code changes minimal** - I'd rather build up the project step by step than have large blocks of code all at once
* **Ask clarifying questions** if anything is unclear rather than making assumptions
* **Use Windows file paths** (backslashes) in all file operations
* **Provide Windows command line instructions** when giving terminal commands

Please begin by reviewing the current project state and confirming your understanding of the Phase 1.3 Part 7 requirements.

## Additional Context
* All 29 rubric-related tests are currently passing
* Enhanced validation includes:
  - Weight validation shows actual vs expected values
  - Weight sum errors include breakdown of all criteria weights
  - Duplicate criterion name prevention
  - Field descriptions for better API documentation
* Test scripts from Part 6:
  - `scripts/test_rubric_error_handling.py` - Comprehensive error testing
  - `test_rubric_validation.py` - Local validation demonstration
  - `test_rubric_api_validation.py` - API-based validation testing
* The project follows an incremental development approach that has been successful
* Mock authentication is in place (returns "teacher-123")
