# Virtual Client - Project Roadmap

## 🎯 Project Vision

An educational application designed to help social work students practice client interactions through AI-powered simulations. The app allows teachers to create virtual clients with specific demographics and issues, upload evaluation rubrics, and enables students to engage in realistic practice sessions with automated feedback.

### Core Value Proposition
- **For Teachers**: Create realistic virtual clients, design evaluation criteria, monitor student progress
- **For Students**: Practice difficult conversations safely, receive immediate feedback, build confidence
- **For Programs**: Standardize training quality, track outcomes, reduce resource needs
