# Phase 1.4 Part 1 - Complete Summary

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Created Database Models (`backend/models/course_section.py`)

**SQLAlchemy Models:**
- `CourseSectionDB` - Represents course sections owned by teachers
  - Fields: id, teacher_id, name, description, course_code, term, is_active, created_at, settings
  - Relationship: One-to-many with enrollments (cascade delete)
  
- `SectionEnrollmentDB` - Links students to course sections
  - Fields: id, section_id, student_id, enrolled_at, is_active, role
  - Soft delete support via is_active flag
  - Future support for teaching assistant role

### 2. Created Pydantic Schemas

**Request Schemas:**
- `CourseSectionCreate` - For creating new sections
  - Required: name only
  - Optional: description, course_code, term, settings
  - Validation: name length 1-200 chars, course_code max 20 chars
  
- `CourseSectionUpdate` - For partial updates
  - All fields optional
  
- `SectionEnrollmentCreate` - For enrolling students
  - Required: student_id
  - Optional: role (defaults to "student")
  - Validation: role must be "student" or "ta"

**Response Schemas:**
- `CourseSection` - Full section details with metadata
  - Includes enrollment_count for convenience
  
- `SectionEnrollment` - Enrollment details
  - Includes optional student_name for enhanced responses

### 3. Updated Model Registry

- Added imports to `backend/models/__init__.py`
- All new models are now available for import from backend.models

### 4. Database Integration

- Models inherit from SQLAlchemy Base
- Tables will be automatically created when Base.metadata.create_all() is called
- Foreign key relationships properly defined
- Cascade delete for enrollments when section is deleted

### 5. Created Comprehensive Tests

- `tests/unit/test_course_section.py` with 3 test classes:
  - Database model tests (instantiation, persistence, relationships)
  - Schema validation tests (create, update, response)
  - Edge case tests (validation rules, constraints)
  
- Test verification script: `test_course_section_models.py`

## Key Design Decisions Implemented

1. **Soft Delete for Enrollments**: `is_active` flag preserves enrollment history
2. **Flexible Settings**: JSON field allows section-specific configurations
3. **Teacher Ownership**: All sections tied to teacher_id for isolation
4. **Future TA Support**: Role field ready for teaching assistants
5. **Minimal Requirements**: Only section name is required, everything else optional

## What's Ready for Part 2

The foundation is now in place for the Section Service layer:
- Models are defined and tested
- Database schema is ready
- Relationships are established
- Validation rules are implemented

## Files Created/Modified

1. **Created:** `backend/models/course_section.py` (167 lines)
2. **Modified:** `backend/models/__init__.py` (added imports)
3. **Created:** `tests/unit/test_course_section.py` (264 lines)
4. **Created:** `test_course_section_models.py` (verification script)

## Next Step: Part 2 - Basic Section Service

Create `backend/services/section_service.py` with:
- SectionService class inheriting from BaseCRUD
- Teacher-filtered methods: get_teacher_sections, create_section_for_teacher
- Permission methods: can_update, can_delete
