# Phase 1.4 Part 4 - Enrollment Service Layer

**Completed**: 45 minutes | **Status**: âœ… Complete

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive service for managing student enrollments in course sections with soft delete functionality for maintaining enrollment history.

## What Was Built

### Service Implementation (`backend/services/enrollment_service.py`)

Created `EnrollmentService` class with the following methods:

1. **`enroll_student(db, section_id, student_id, role="student")`**
   - Enrolls a student in a section
   - Prevents duplicate active enrollments
   - Reactivates inactive enrollments if student re-enrolls
   - Validates section exists before enrolling
   - Returns None for invalid sections

2. **`unenroll_student(db, section_id, student_id)`**
   - Soft deletes enrollment (sets is_active=False)
   - Preserves enrollment history
   - Returns True if successful, False if not found/already inactive

3. **`get_section_roster(db, section_id, include_inactive=False)`**
   - Retrieves all enrollments for a section
   - By default returns only active enrollments
   - Can optionally include inactive enrollments
   - Orders by enrollment date

4. **`is_student_enrolled(db, section_id, student_id)`**
   - Checks if student is actively enrolled
   - Returns boolean (True/False)
   - Only considers active enrollments

5. **`get_student_sections(db, student_id, include_inactive=False)`**
   - Gets all sections a student is enrolled in
   - Returns full CourseSection objects
   - Orders by enrollment date (most recent first)
   - Can optionally include sections with inactive enrollments

### Business Rules Implemented

- **No Duplicate Enrollments**: Students cannot be enrolled twice in the same section
- **Soft Delete Pattern**: Unenrollment sets is_active=False rather than deleting records
- **Enrollment History**: All enrollments are preserved for audit/history
- **Section Validation**: Cannot enroll in non-existent sections
- **Reactivation**: Re-enrolling after unenrollment reactivates the existing record

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Created `tests/unit/test_enrollment_service.py` with 20 test cases covering:
- Service instantiation
- Successful enrollment and TA role enrollment
- Duplicate enrollment handling
- Enrollment reactivation
- Invalid section handling
- Successful unenrollment and edge cases
- Roster retrieval (active/inactive)
- Enrollment status checking
- Student section retrieval

### Test Issues and Resolution

**Initial Problem**: SQLAlchemy DetachedInstanceError
- Test sections were being created in a different database session than the one used in test methods
- Sections created in `setup_method` weren't visible in test methods

**Solution**:
1. Converted test sections to a pytest fixture using same session
2. Created `@pytest.fixture test_sections(db_session)` 
3. Created `@pytest.fixture student_ids()` for consistent IDs
4. Removed setup/teardown methods (pytest handles cleanup)
5. All database operations now use the same session context

**Key Learning**: When using pytest with SQLAlchemy, ensure all database operations in a test use the same session.

## Key Implementation Details

### Soft Delete Implementation
```python
def unenroll_student(self, db: Session, section_id: str, student_id: str) -> bool:
    enrollment = db.query(SectionEnrollmentDB).filter(
        SectionEnrollmentDB.section_id == section_id,
        SectionEnrollmentDB.student_id == student_id,
        SectionEnrollmentDB.is_active == True
    ).first()
    
    if enrollment:
        enrollment.is_active = False  # Soft delete
        db.commit()
        return True
    return False
```

### Reactivation Pattern
```python
# Check for existing enrollment (active or inactive)
existing = db.query(SectionEnrollmentDB).filter(
    SectionEnrollmentDB.section_id == section_id,
    SectionEnrollmentDB.student_id == student_id
).first()

if existing:
    if existing.is_active:
        return existing  # Already enrolled
    else:
        # Reactivate
        existing.is_active = True
        existing.enrolled_at = datetime.utcnow()
        db.commit()
        return existing
```

## Code Quality Highlights

- **Type Hints**: Full type annotations for better IDE support
- **Docstrings**: Comprehensive documentation with business rules
- **Logging**: Appropriate logging at info/warning levels
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases
- **Test Coverage**: Extensive unit tests covering all scenarios
- **DRY Principle**: Inherits from BaseCRUD for standard operations

## Files Created/Modified

1. **Created**: `backend/services/enrollment_service.py` (185 lines)
2. **Created**: `tests/unit/test_enrollment_service.py` (450+ lines)
3. **Created**: `test_enrollment_service.py` (manual test script)
4. **Created**: `test_enrollment_unit.py` (test runner)

## Next Steps
With the enrollment service complete, the project was ready for Part 5: creating API endpoints to expose this functionality to teachers.
