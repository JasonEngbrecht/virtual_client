# Phase 1.2 Part 3 - Complete! ✅

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Created `backend/api/teacher_routes.py`
- Minimal FastAPI router with prefix and tags
- Two test endpoints:
  - `GET /test` - Simple endpoint to verify router works
  - `GET /test-db` - Endpoint with database dependency injection

### 2. Updated `backend/app.py`
- Imported teacher_routes module
- Included router with `/api` prefix
- Routes now accessible at `/api/teacher/*`

### 3. Created Testing Files
- `test_part3.py` - Automated endpoint testing
- `PHASE_1_2_PART3_TESTING.md` - Manual testing guide

## How to Test

### Option 1: Manual Testing (Recommended)
1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn backend.app:app --reload
   ```

2. Visit these URLs in your browser:
   - http://localhost:8000/api/teacher/test
   - http://localhost:8000/api/teacher/test-db
   - http://localhost:8000/docs (API documentation)

### Option 2: Automated Test
```bash
python test_part3.py
```
Note: This starts a server on port 8001 to avoid conflicts

### Option 3: Using curl
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/teacher/test
curl http://localhost:8000/api/teacher/test-db
```

## What's Working

✅ Router properly integrated into FastAPI app
✅ Endpoints accessible with correct prefix
✅ Database dependency injection working
✅ API documentation auto-generated
✅ Ready for CRUD endpoints

## API Structure

```
/api
  /teacher
    /test         GET  - Test endpoint
    /test-db      GET  - Database test endpoint
    /clients      GET  - (Part 4: List clients)
    /clients      POST - (Part 4: Create client)
    /clients/{id} GET  - (Part 4: Get client)
    /clients/{id} PUT  - (Part 4: Update client)
    /clients/{id} DELETE - (Part 4: Delete client)
```

## Next Steps

**Part 4: Add CRUD Endpoints One at a Time**
- Start with GET /clients (list)
- Add POST /clients (create)
- Add GET /clients/{id} (retrieve)
- Add PUT /clients/{id} (update)
- Add DELETE /clients/{id} (delete)

Each endpoint will be implemented and tested before moving to the next.
